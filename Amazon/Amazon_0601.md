Next Greater Element II. Return a list of pairs — either (element, next_greater_element) or (element, -1) if no greater element exists. I solved it using a monotonic stack.

Loop(5 rounds)

Coding - Design the search API file + 2 LP

System design - design a log storage + 2 LP

Coding Design - Design a system to install packages. You are required to support the installation of a package and all of its dependent packages + 2 LP

Behaivoral - 3 LP

Behaivoral - 4 LP

I received the result 9 days later through an online meeting with the recruiter. I had the very mixed feedback and they expected more complex LP.
I'm not sure why they didn’t reject me by email, as Amazon typically doesn’t provide any feedback unless the candidate specifically asks. The recruiter explained that it was just the result and a brief comment. I’ve heard stories where candidates are simply ghosted or rejected via a templated email therefor it wasn’t typical behavior for Amazon

P.S I really advise preparing for other FAANG companies excluding Amazon
