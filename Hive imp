understand that the fsimage is loaded into the memory on startup and any further transactions are added to the edit log rather than to the fsimage for performance reasons. The fsimage in memory gets refreshed when the namenode is restarted. For efficiency, secondary name node periodically does a checkpoint to update the fsimage so that the namenode recovery is faster. All these are fine

Sequence files are flat files consisting of binary key-value pairs.

Now to load data into this table is somewhat different from loading into the table created using TEXTFILE format. You need to insert the data from another table because this SEQUENCEFILE format is binary format. It compresses the data and then stores it into the table. If you want to load directly as in TEXTFILE format that is not possible because we cannot insert the compressed files into tables.

SerializerDeserializer (SerDe) for sqeunce file format:
-———————————————————————————
There are two SerDe for SequenceFile as follows:

TextSerializerDeserializer: This class can read and write data in plain text file format.
BinarySerializerDeserializer: This class can read and write data in binary file format

There are three SequenceFile Writers based on the SequenceFile.CompressionType used to compress key/value pairs:
Writer : Uncompressed records.
RecordCompressWriter : Record-compressed files, only compress values.
BlockCompressWriter : Block-compressed files, both keys & values are collected in ‘blocks’ separately and compressed. The size of the ‘block’ is configurable.
The actual compression algorithm used to compress key and/or values can be specified by using the appropriate CompressionCodec.
Enabling Compression for SequenceFile Tables——-
hive> SET hive.exec.compress.output=true;
hive> SET mapred.max.split.size=256000000;
hive> SET mapred.output.compression.type=BLOCK;
hive> SET mapred.output.compression.codec=org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.SnappyCodec;
hive> insert overwrite table new_table select * from old_table;
for partiiton table-
hive> create table new_table (your_cols) partitioned by (partition_cols) stored as new_format;
hive> SET hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode=nonstrict;
hive> SET hive.exec.dynamic.partition=true;
hive> insert overwrite table new_table partition(comma_separated_partition_cols) select * from old_table;

To complete a similar process for a table that includes partitions, you would specify settings similar to the following:

hive> CREATE TABLE tbl_seq (int_col INT, string_col STRING) PARTITIONED BY (year INT) STORED AS SEQUENCEFILE;
hive> SET hive.exec.compress.output=true;
hive> SET mapred.max.split.size=256000000;
hive> SET mapred.output.compression.type=BLOCK;
hive> SET mapred.output.compression.codec=org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.SnappyCodec;
hive> SET hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode=nonstrict;
hive> SET hive.exec.dynamic.partition=true;
hive> INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE tbl_seq PARTITION SELECT * FROM tbl;

RC FIle format :
org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.RCFileInputFormat
org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.RCFileOutputFormat
and 4. The term “index” is rather inappropriate. Basically it’s just min/max information persisted in the stripe footer at write time, then used at read time for skipping all stripes that are clearly not meeting the WHERE requirements, drastically reducing I/O in some cases (a trick that has become popular in columns stores e.g. InfoBright on MySQL, but also in Oracle Exadata appliances [dubbed “smart scan” by Oracle marketing])
-———————————————————————————————————————————————
diffence btw orc and rc file format—
ORC offers a number of features not available in RC files:

    Better encoding of data. Integer values are run length encoded. Strings and dates are stored in a dictionary (and the resulting pointers then run length encoded).
    Internal indexes and statistics on the data. This allows for more efficient reading of the data as well as skipping of sections of the data not relevant to a given query. These indexes can also be used by the Hive optimizer to help plan query execution.
    Predicate push down for some predicates. For example, in the query “select * from user where state = ‘ca’”, ORC could look at a collection of rows and use the indexes to see that no rows in that group have that value, and thus skip the group altogether.
    Tight integration with Hive’s vectorized execution, which produces much faster processing of rows
    Support for new ACID features in Hive (transactional insert, update, and delete).
    It has a much faster read time than RCFile and compresses much more efficiently.

Whether ORC is the best format for what you’re doing depends on the data you’re storing and how you are querying it. If you are storing data where you know the schema and you are doing analytic type queries it’s the best choice (in fairness, some would dispute this and choose Parquet, though much of what I said above about ORC vs RC applies to Parquet as well). If you are doing queries that select the whole row each time columnar formats like ORC won’t be your friend. Also, if you are storing self structured data such as JSON or Avro you may find text or Avro storage to be a better format.

secorndary nameNode ::
As the NameNode is the single point of failure in HDFS, if NameNode fails entire HDFS file system is lost. So in order to overcome this, Hadoop implemented Secondary NameNode whose main function is to store a copy of FsImage file and edits log file.

FsImage is a snapshot of the HDFS file system metadata at a certain point of time and EditLog is a transaction log which contains records for every change that occurs to file system metadata. So, at any point of time, applying edits log records to FsImage (recently saved copy) will give the current status of FsImage, i.e. file system metadata.

Whenever a NameNode is restarted, the latest status of FsImage is built by applying edits records on last saved copy of FsImage. Since, NameNode merges FsImage and EditLog files only at start up, the edits log file might get very large over time on a busy cluster. That means, if the EditLog is very large, NameNode restart process result in some considerable delay in the availability of file system. So, it is important keep the edits log as small as possible which is one of the main functions of Secondary NameNode.

Secondary NameNode Functions:

1. Stores a copy of FsImage file and edits log.

2. Periodically applies edits log records to FsImage file and refreshes the edits log. And sends this updated FsImage file to NameNode so that NameNode doesn’t need to re-apply the EditLog records during its start up process. Thus Secondary NameNode makes NameNode start up process fast.

3. If NameNode is failed, File System metadata can be recovered from the last saved FsImage on the Secondary NameNode but Secondary NameNode can’t take the primary NameNode’s functionality.

4. Check pointing of File system metadata is performed.
