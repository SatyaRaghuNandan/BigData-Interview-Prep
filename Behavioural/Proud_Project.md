STAR Response: Barclays Streaming Platform (BSP)
Situation
I’m most proud of my work on the Barclays Streaming Platform (BSP), a mission-critical system for real-time financial data processing. BSP supports diverse tenants, from small accounts to high-volume trading systems, handling sensitive financial data with strict PII compliance and data correctness requirements. The challenge was to build a scalable, secure, and efficient platform to meet varied tenant needs in a high-stakes financial environment.
Task
As a lead engineer, I owned the design and implementation of BSP’s streaming and analytics infrastructure. My responsibilities included architecting multi-tenant pipelines, ensuring data durability, scaling across on-prem and AWS, automating tenant onboarding, and driving feature development. I also led monitoring, cost optimization, and cross-team adoption to maximize BSP’s impact.
Action

Built Streaming and Analytics Pipeline: Designed a Kafka-based streaming layer to handle high-throughput financial data, using topic partitioning for tenant isolation. Integrated Flink for real-time analytics, enabling trade monitoring with sub-second latency. Optimized resource allocation for small and large tenants, improving efficiency by 20%.
Ensured Data Integrity and Security: Configured Kafka with replication and acks=all for zero data loss and Flink with exactly-once processing for transaction accuracy. Implemented AWS KMS encryption and CSM certificate-based authentication to meet PII and regulatory standards.
Scaled Infrastructure: Led hybrid infrastructure strategy, using on-prem servers for low-latency trading and AWS ECS for elastic scaling. Optimized server procurement, cutting costs by 18% while achieving 99.99% uptime.
Automated Onboarding: Developed a GitLab CI/CD pipeline for tenant provisioning, integrating role-based authentication and automated certificate issuance. This reduced onboarding time by 70%, enabling self-service for new tenants.
Enhanced Monitoring: Set up Prometheus and Grafana to track Kafka lag, Flink latency, and tenant metrics. Resolved a Flink performance issue, reducing latency by 20%, and built dashboards for traders to monitor performance.
Drove Features and Adoption: Added real-time alerts and failover capabilities, boosting reliability. Created APIs and trained teams on BSP, enabling two business units to adopt it, increasing platform usage by 30%.

Result
BSP became a cornerstone of Barclays’ financial operations, supporting 40+ tenants with zero data loss and 99.99% uptime over 18 months. Onboarding automation saved 70% of setup time, infrastructure optimizations cut costs by ~$350K annually, and analytics improved trading efficiency by 12%. My leadership and APIs drove adoption across teams, earning recognition from senior management.



Follow ups: 
I apologize that the previous responses didn’t fully meet your needs. I’ll provide another version of your answer for the Meta E5/E6 interview question, "What is your most proud project?" focusing on the Barclays Streaming Platform (BSP). This version will be even more concise, emphasize your technical leadership and impact with a stronger focus on business outcomes, and align closely with Meta’s expectations for E5/E6 roles (system design, ownership, and cross-team influence). I’ll use the STAR method, incorporate your details (Kafka, Flink, Prometheus, multi-tenancy, onboarding, infrastructure), and address Meta’s rigorous follow-up style. I’ll also ensure the response feels fresh while keeping it direct and impactful.

### Anticipated Follow-Up Questions
Meta’s interviewers will probe technical details, trade-offs, and leadership. Here’s how to handle likely questions:

1. **System Design**:
   - *Question*: "How did BSP handle multi-tenancy?"
     - **Response**: "Kafka topics were partitioned by tenant, with dynamic scaling for large traders. Flink jobs used tenant-specific configs for isolated analytics, balancing resource use."
   - *Question*: "Why Kafka and Flink over alternatives?"
     - **Response**: "Kafka’s partitioning and durability were ideal for high-throughput data. Flink’s low-latency, exactly-once processing fit real-time analytics, unlike Spark’s batch model."

2. **Challenges**:
   - *Question*: "What was a key challenge?"
     - **Response**: "A Kafka lag issue impacted a trading tenant. I used Prometheus to identify partition imbalances, tuned configurations, and cut lag by 20%."
   - *Question*: "Any failures?"
     - **Response**: "An onboarding bug delayed access. I fixed the pipeline, added tests, and communicated with stakeholders, preventing recurrence."

3. **Scalability**:
   - *Question*: "How would you scale for 100 tenants?"
     - **Response**: "I’d add Kafka brokers, use AWS MSK for managed scaling, and optimize Flink’s state backend. A tenant registry would streamline management."
   - *Question*: "Next features?"
     - **Response**: “ML-driven trade predictions in Flink and cross-region Kafka replication for global reliability.”

4. **Leadership**:
   - *Question*: "How did you align stakeholders?"
     - **Response**: "I used metrics to prioritize features like alerts, securing buy-in for a rollout that boosted adoption by 30%."
