Here is the **6-line explanation** of the approach for `swimInWater`:

1. We want to find the **minimum time `T`** such that we can reach from the top-left to the bottom-right cell, where the **water level is ‚â§ `T`**.
2. Since the water level rises uniformly, we can **binary search on `T`**, from `grid[0][0]` to `n¬≤ - 1`.
3. For each mid `T`, we use **DFS** to check if a path exists from `(0,0)` to `(n-1,n-1)` where **all cells are ‚â§ `T`**.
4. If such a path exists, we try a **smaller `T`** (move left in binary search).
5. Otherwise, we must **increase `T`** (move right in binary search).
6. Finally, we return the smallest `T` for which a valid path exists ‚Äî this is our answer.

Great question! Yes, this **is indeed a Binary Search on Answer** problem ‚Äî here's **why and how** it turns out that way:

### ‚úÖ Why This Becomes a Binary Search Problem:

1. **Goal:** You are asked to **find the minimum time `T`** such that it's *possible* to swim from `(0,0)` to `(n-1,n-1)`.

2. **Monotonic Property:** If you can reach the destination at time `T`, then you can also do it at any time `T+1, T+2, ...`.
   Similarly, if you cannot reach at time `T`, then it's **impossible** at any time `< T`.

   üëâ **This monotonic nature** (false ‚Üí false ‚Üí false ‚Üí true ‚Üí true ‚Üí ‚Ä¶) allows us to apply **binary search** over the time `T`.

3. **Search Space:**

   * Minimum possible time = `grid[0][0]` (starting height)
   * Maximum = `n¬≤ - 1` (since all values from `0` to `n¬≤-1` are unique in the grid)

4. For each candidate time `T`, you check:

   * ‚ÄúCan I swim from start to end **without stepping into any cell > T**?‚Äù
   * This is done via DFS or BFS.

5. Binary Search helps find the **smallest `T`** that makes the path possible ‚Äî hence, **‚ÄúBinary Search on Answer‚Äù**.

### üîÅ Summary in 2 Lines:

This isn't a binary search on indices, but a **binary search on the range of possible answers** (`T`).
That‚Äôs what makes it a perfect fit for the "Binary Search on Monotonic Function" category in Leetcode.

Let me know if you want a diagram or real dry run example to solidify this idea!

### ‚úÖ Approach Summary in Plain English

1. You want to **find the minimum time `T`** such that you can reach from (0, 0) to (n-1, n-1) with water level ‚â§ `T`.
2. You perform **Binary Search** on `T` from `grid[0][0]` to `n*n - 1`.
3. For each `T`, you **use DFS** to check if a valid path exists where all cells ‚â§ `T`.
4. If yes, try smaller `T` (left side of binary search), else increase `T`.
5. The first time `T` that allows a path is your **answer**.
