Great question! Let's walk through **why DFS is the best traversal choice** for the `averageOfSubtree` problem.

---

### ✅ Problem Recap

You’re given a binary tree. For every node, you need to:

* Compute the **average of all nodes in its subtree**, including itself.
* If the node’s value is **equal to the integer average** of its subtree, count it.

---

### ✅ Why **DFS** Is Best (Depth-First Search)

#### 🔹 1. **Subtree Aggregation Needs Bottom-Up Info**

DFS (especially **post-order**) is ideal when:

* You need information **from the child nodes first** before processing the current node.
* In this problem, to compute:

  * `sum of subtree`
  * `count of nodes in subtree`

  You must **visit children before the parent** — that’s exactly what **post-order DFS** does.

---

#### 🔹 2. **Efficient Use of Recursion**

* DFS uses **recursion naturally** to traverse and collect:

  * Left subtree → Right subtree → Then parent.
* You can efficiently **return `{sum, count}`** for every subtree in a single pass.
* Example:

  ```java
  int[] left = dfs(node.left);  // → [sum, count]
  int[] right = dfs(node.right);
  int totalSum = node.val + left[0] + right[0];
  int totalCount = 1 + left[1] + right[1];
  ```

---

#### 🔹 3. **Single-Pass Traversal**

* DFS ensures **O(N)** time: Each node is visited **exactly once**.
* BFS or Level Order traversal would be awkward here — you’d need:

  * Extra space to maintain a queue.
  * A second traversal or recursion to compute subtree sums for each node, increasing **time complexity to O(N²)**.

---

### 🔁 DFS Traversal Order for This Problem

```text
Post-order:
1. Traverse left
2. Traverse right
3. Process node (calculate sum + count, update result)
```

---

### 🚫 Why Not BFS?

If you used **BFS (Level Order)**:

* You’d have to **recompute the entire subtree sum and count** for each node.
* You'd repeat computation for overlapping subtrees.
* Becomes inefficient quickly for larger trees → **O(N²)** time in worst case.

### ✅ Summary Table

| Criteria                     | DFS (Post-order) | BFS         |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| Subtree sum/count from child | ✅ Easy           | ❌ Hard      |
| Time Complexity              | ✅ O(N)           | ❌ O(N²)     |
| Space (excluding recursion)  | ✅ O(H)           | ❌ O(N)      |
| Matches problem flow         | ✅ Naturally      | ❌ Not ideal |

---

### ✅ Final Verdict

> ✅ **DFS is optimal here** because you need **child node info before computing the parent’s logic** — exactly what post-order traversal gives you.

```java

class Solution {
    int result = 0; // ✅ Ee variable lo manam final answer store chestham

    public int averageOfSubtree(TreeNode root) {
        dfs(root); // ✅ Root node nunchi DFS start chestham
        return result; // ✅ Result return cheyyadam
    }

    // ✅ Ee DFS function oka node ki tana subtree lo unna sum and count return chesthundi
    private int[] dfs(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            // ✅ Leaf node reach ayyaka, empty node ki sum=0, count=0 return cheyyali
            return new int[] {0, 0};
        }

        // ✅ Left child nunchi sum and count thisukuntam
        int[] leftNode = dfs(root.left);

        // ✅ Right child nunchi sum and count thisukuntam
        int[] rightNode = dfs(root.right);

        // ✅ Total sum = current node value + left subtree sum + right subtree sum
        int totalSum = root.val + leftNode[0] + rightNode[0];

        // ✅ Total count = 1 (current node) + left count + right count
        int totalCount = 1 + leftNode[1] + rightNode[1];

        // ✅ Integer average ni calculate chesi, root value tho compare cheyyali
        if (root.val == totalSum / totalCount) {
            result++; // ✅ Match aithe result increment cheyyadam
        }

        // ✅ Ee node ki sammaninchina sum and count ni return cheyyali
        return new int[] {totalSum, totalCount};
    }
}
