Fantastic follow-up! You're asking **"Why not use BFS to compute the diameter of a binary tree?"** — this is a very smart question and shows deep thinking.

Let’s answer that by comparing the **goals of the problem** with the **nature of BFS vs DFS**.

---

## ✅ Why DFS is Preferred (Recap)

**DFS** helps you compute **height of subtrees** recursively, and at **each node**, you can calculate:

```text
diameter_through_node = left_height + right_height
```

This is crucial because:

* Height is a **bottom-up** property
* To calculate the height, you must **visit children first** → naturally suited for **post-order DFS**

---

## ❌ Why BFS is **not preferred** for Diameter:

### 🔴 1. BFS is **level-order**, not bottom-up

* BFS gives nodes **level by level** — which is **top-down**
* But **diameter requires info from children first** (i.e., subtree height)

### 🔴 2. Height of subtrees not easily tracked

* In BFS, when visiting a node, you haven’t computed the height of its children yet.
* You’d need **extra data structures** or **multi-pass BFS** to track height.

### 🔴 3. BFS can tell depth from root, but not height of subtree

* You can get **depth** from the root to any node using BFS
* But you can't compute height of subtree rooted at arbitrary node without DFS

## 📌 Exception: BFS for Tree Diameter in Graph Format (not binary tree)

In **graph problems**, diameter is sometimes computed using:

1. BFS from any node → find farthest node A
2. BFS from A → find farthest node B
3. Distance(A, B) = diameter

✅ This works for **unweighted undirected trees**, **not binary trees with structure**.

## ⚖️ Summary Table: DFS vs BFS for Diameter

| Aspect                  | DFS                              | BFS                          |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Subtree height tracking | ✅ Natural (post-order)           | ❌ Not directly possible      |
| Path tracking           | ✅ Combine left + right           | ❌ Requires additional logic  |
| Space efficiency        | ✅ O(H)                           | ✅ O(W), but no height info   |
| Real-world use          | ✅ Commonly used in tree problems | ❌ Not ideal for this problem |
| Interview readability   | ✅ Clean & elegant                | ❌ Complex to reason          |

## ✅ Verdict (Interview Guidance):

> Use **DFS (post-order)** to solve diameter of binary tree.
> It’s elegant, recursive, and interviewers love how it combines **height + diameter** calculation in a single pass.
