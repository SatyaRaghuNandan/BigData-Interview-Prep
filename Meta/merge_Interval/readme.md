Here’s your `merge()` function with **Telugu comments** (transliterated in English), along with **time and space complexity analysis**:

### ✅ Python Code with Telugu Comments

```python
class Solution:
    def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        # Step 1: Start time ni base chesi intervals ni sort chestham
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

        result = []  # Final merged intervals ni ikkada store chestham

        for curr in intervals:
            # Step 2: result empty unte or current start time > last interval end time aithe
            # overlap ledu kabatti direct ga result lo add cheyyali
            if not result or curr[0] > result[-1][1]:
                result.append(curr)
            else:
                # Step 3: overlap vunte, merge cheyyali by updating the end time
                # max end time ni teesukoni merge cheyyadam
                result[-1][1] = max(result[-1][1], curr[1])

        return result  # Final merged intervals ni return chestham
```

### 🧠 Time Complexity

```text
O(N log N) — Sorting the intervals based on start time
O(N)       — One pass to merge intervals

Total: O(N log N)
```

* N = number of intervals

---

### 💾 Space Complexity

```text
O(N) — In worst case, all intervals are non-overlapping, so result list holds all intervals.
```

* If in-place merge is allowed (and overwriting input is okay), space can be reduced, but `result` list uses up to O(N) space here.

---

### 📌 Sample Input & Output

```python
Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
```

Let me know if you want the **Java version with Telugu comments**, or a **dry run of a tricky input** for practice!





Great observation! LeetCode's explanation is accurate, but let me break it down and offer **slightly more precise** alternatives and clarifications depending on how you're sorting and using space — especially in interview discussions.

## ✅ Your Code Review (with Clarity in Mind)

```python
intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])  # This is an in-place sort
```

Python’s built-in `list.sort()`:

* **Sorts in-place**
* **Uses Timsort**, which has **O(log N)** space complexity in the **worst case** due to recursion stack.

```python
result = []  # This is an auxiliary list that can hold up to N intervals
```

So your code uses:

| Component          | Space Used                         |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Sorting (in-place) | O(log N) auxiliary space (Timsort) |
| `result` list      | O(N) worst case (no merges)        |

---

## 🧠 Final Clarified Space Complexity

### ✅ Best Explanation for Interviews:

> **Space complexity: O(N)**
> due to the `result` list that may hold all intervals in the worst case.
> **Note:** Sorting is done in-place using Timsort, which takes **O(log N)** auxiliary space.

---

## ✅ LeetCode’s Line: Should You Change It?

### Original:

> **Space complexity: O(log N) (or O(N))**

### 🔍 More Accurate Variant:

You could rephrase it to **clarify the reason** for O(N):

> **Space complexity: O(N)**
> to store the output list.
> Sorting is done in-place using Timsort, which uses **O(log N)** auxiliary space internally.

---

## ✅ In Short:

* ✔ **Your code’s actual space complexity is O(N)** because of the `result` list.
* 🔎 **Timsort's O(log N)** space is *auxiliary* and smaller in comparison.
* 📘 **Always mention O(N)** if the result list is not reusing the input — which is true in your code.

Let me know if you'd like a version that merges **in-place in the input list** (to bring down additional space)!
