Here‚Äôs the **same code** for merging intervals (`merge_56_python`) with **detailed Telugu comments (in English script)**, along with **time/space complexity analysis** and a **quick example** for better understanding:

### ‚úÖ Python Code with Telugu Comments

```python
from typing import List

def merge_56_python(intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # ‚úÖ Step 1: Intervals ni start time (x[0]) tho sort cheyyadam
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    result = []
    for curr_interval in intervals:
        # ‚úÖ result empty lekapote, new interval start time > previous end time aithe overlap ledu
        if not result or curr_interval[0] > result[-1][1]:
            result.append(curr_interval)  # ‚úÖ overlap ledu ‚Üí new interval add cheyyadam
        else:
            # ‚úÖ overlap undi ‚Üí merge cheyyali ‚Üí max of current end and previous end
            result[-1][1] = max(curr_interval[1], result[-1][1])

    return result
```

### üß† Quick Example

```python
intervals = [[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
merge_56_python(intervals)
```

**Output**:

```python
[[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
```

**Explanation**:

* \[1, 3] and \[2, 6] ‚Üí overlap ‚Üí merge to \[1, 6]
* \[8, 10] ‚Üí no overlap with \[1, 6]
* \[15, 18] ‚Üí no overlap with previous

### ‚è±Ô∏è Time and Space Complexity

| Metric               | Value      | Explanation                                 |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Time Complexity**  | O(n log n) | Due to sorting step                         |
| **Space Complexity** | O(n)       | For storing the result list (in worst case) |

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

* Efficient for merging overlapping intervals.
* Takes O(n log n) time due to sorting.
* `result[-1][1] = max(...)` helps combine intervals smartly.

Let me know if you want to **implement this in C++/Java**, or modify it for **non-overlapping insertions** like LeetCode 57.
