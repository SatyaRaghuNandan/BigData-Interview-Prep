You're absolutely right — this solution is optimal for **Leetcode 34: Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array** using **Binary Search**. Let me break it down for you in **plain English**, with a **step-by-step dry run** on an example so you can remember it better.

---

## ✅ Problem Summary:

Given a **sorted array** of integers `nums` and a `target`, return the **first and last position** of the `target`.
If not found, return `[-1, -1]`.

---

## ✅ Example:

```java
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3, 4]
```

---

## ✅ Plain English Strategy:

We’ll use **binary search** twice:

1. 🔍 **First Search**: To find the **first position** of the `target`.
2. 🔁 **Second Search**: To find the **last position** of the `target`.

Why binary search twice?
Because it’s **log(n)** efficient and avoids scanning the whole array.

---

## ✅ Function Breakdown

### Step 1: `searchRange(nums, target)`

* Call `findBoundary(nums, target, true)` → find **first index** of `target`
* Call `findBoundary(nums, target, false)` → find **last index** of `target`
* If target not found (first index is -1) → return `[-1, -1]`

---

## ✅ Let’s Dry Run:

Take input:

```java
nums = [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10]
target = 8
```

---

### 🔹 First Call: `findBoundary(nums, 8, true)`

> Goal: Find the **first index** of 8

#### Initial values:

`left = 0`, `right = 5`

#### Round 1:

`mid = (0+5)/2 = 2` → `nums[2] = 7`
Since 7 < 8 → Move right → `left = mid + 1 = 3`

#### Round 2:

`mid = (3+5)/2 = 4` → `nums[4] = 8`
We found `target`!
Now check:

* Is this the first occurrence? → `nums[3] == 8` → So No → Move left → `right = mid - 1 = 3`

#### Round 3:

`mid = (3+3)/2 = 3` → `nums[3] = 8`
Check again:

* Is this first occurrence? → `nums[2] = 7` ≠ 8 → YES! 🎯
  ✅ Return `3`

---

### 🔹 Second Call: `findBoundary(nums, 8, false)`

> Goal: Find the **last index** of 8

#### Initial:

`left = 0`, `right = 5`

#### Round 1:

`mid = 2` → `nums[2] = 7`
→ 7 < 8 → `left = mid + 1 = 3`

#### Round 2:

`mid = 4` → `nums[4] = 8`
→ Check if last? `nums[5] = 10` ≠ 8 → ✅ YES! 🎯
✅ Return `4`

---

### 🔹 Final Output:

```java
return [3, 4]
```

---

## ✅ Key Reminders (Mnemonic):

To remember:

* **Do Binary Search Twice** – once for first, once for last
* Use `isFirst` flag to control:

  * `left boundary` ➝ `right = mid - 1`
  * `right boundary` ➝ `left = mid + 1`

---

## ✅ When is Target Found?

```java
if (nums[mid] == target)
```

* Check **boundary condition**:

  * First: `mid == left` or `nums[mid - 1] != target`
  * Last: `mid == right` or `nums[mid + 1] != target`

---

Would you like me to give a dry run for a case where the element is **not found** or **appears only once** to help lock the logic in your memory?
