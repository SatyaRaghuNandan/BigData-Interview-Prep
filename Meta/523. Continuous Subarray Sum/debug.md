Perfect! You're asking the **right question**. Let's debug **your code as-is** — without using `prefixSum`, only using the variable `prefixMod`, which is used **instead of explicitly storing prefixSum**.

---

### ✅ Your Code Recap:

```java
int prefixMod = 0;
Map<Integer, Integer> modSeen = new HashMap<>();
modSeen.put(0, -1); // Special case to handle subarrays starting from index 0
```

You are **accumulating the sum implicitly into `prefixMod`**, like:

```java
prefixMod = (prefixMod + nums[i]) % k;
```

---

### ✅ Example: Happy Path

```java
nums = [23, 2, 4, 6, 7]
k = 6
```

We'll simulate the code **line by line**, tracking all variables.

---

### 🔍 Dry Run Step by Step:

We'll track:

* `i`
* `nums[i]`
* `prefixMod`
* `modSeen` Map
* Action taken

---

#### Initial State:

```java
prefixMod = 0
modSeen = { 0: -1 }  // So we can handle subarrays starting from index 0
```

---

#### i = 0

```java
nums[0] = 23
prefixMod = (0 + 23) % 6 = 5
modSeen = {0: -1}
```

* 5 not in `modSeen` → put (5, 0)

✅ Now: `modSeen = {0: -1, 5: 0}`

---

#### i = 1

```java
nums[1] = 2
prefixMod = (5 + 2) % 6 = 1
modSeen = {0: -1, 5: 0}
```

* 1 not in `modSeen` → put (1, 1)

✅ Now: `modSeen = {0: -1, 5: 0, 1: 1}`

---

#### i = 2

```java
nums[2] = 4
prefixMod = (1 + 4) % 6 = 5
modSeen = {0: -1, 5: 0, 1: 1}
```

* ✅ 5 already in map at index 0
* Check: `i - modSeen.get(5) = 2 - 0 = 2` → `> 1` ✅
  → **Return true**

### 🔁 Summary of Internal State:

| i | nums\[i] | prefixMod | modSeen          | Result      |
| - | -------- | --------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| 0 | 23       | 5         | {0:-1, 5:0}      | Add new     |
| 1 | 2        | 1         | {0:-1, 5:0, 1:1} | Add new     |
| 2 | 4        | 5         | Already seen @ 0 | 2 - 0 = 2 ✅ |

---

### ✅ Output:

```java
true
```

---

### 💡 Key Understanding:

Even though there's no explicit `prefixSum`, the logic:

```java
prefixMod = (prefixMod + nums[i]) % k;
```

is doing **prefix sum modulo `k`** on the fly.

You **don't need to keep the actual sum** — we only care about the **remainder pattern** repeating!

---

### ✅ Summary:

* If you ever see the same `prefixMod` again, it means the subarray between those indices has sum divisible by `k`.
* Check if the subarray is at least length 2 (`i - prevIndex > 1`)
* That’s what the code does beautifully.

Would you like a **failing test case** dry-run to understand when it returns `false`?
