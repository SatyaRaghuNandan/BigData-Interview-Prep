Great question! You're looking for a **conceptual understanding** of the **Divide & Conquer approach to merge K sorted linked lists**, not just memorizing code. That‚Äôs exactly the right way to prepare for a Meta interview.

Let‚Äôs walk through:

---

## ‚úÖ What is the Problem?

You are given `k` sorted linked lists. Your goal is to **merge all of them into one single sorted linked list**.

---

## ‚úÖ Conceptual Idea (NOT mugging up)

### Think in terms of **Divide and Conquer**:

Just like how **Merge Sort** works.

> Instead of merging all k lists at once, we:

1. Pair them up
2. Merge each pair
3. Repeat until one list is left

### Visual Breakdown:

Say you have 4 sorted lists:

```python
lists = [L1, L2, L3, L4]
```

1st round (interval = 1):

```text
L1 + L2 ‚Üí merged into M1
L3 + L4 ‚Üí merged into M2
lists = [M1, M2]
```

2nd round (interval = 2):

```text
M1 + M2 ‚Üí final result
```

This way, each list gets merged log‚ÇÇ(k) times.

---

## ‚úÖ Dry Run: With Example

Let's say we are merging the following:

```python
lists = [
  1 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 5,
  1 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 4,
  2 ‚Üí 6
]
```

### Step 0:

```text
amount = 3
interval = 1
```

### First Loop (interval = 1):

* Merge lists\[0] and lists\[1]:

```text
1 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 5
1 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 4
‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 5
```

Update:

```python
lists[0] = merged
lists = [1‚Üí1‚Üí3‚Üí4‚Üí4‚Üí5, 1‚Üí3‚Üí4, 2‚Üí6]
```

Next:

* Merge lists\[2] and (lists\[3] doesn‚Äôt exist) ‚Üí skip

Now:

```python
interval *= 2 ‚Üí interval = 2
```

---

### Second Loop (interval = 2):

* Merge lists\[0] and lists\[2]:

```text
1 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 5
2 ‚Üí 6
‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 5 ‚Üí 6
```

Now we have:

```python
lists[0] = final merged list
return lists[0]
```

---

## ‚úÖ Time Complexity

Let `N` be the total number of nodes, and `K` be the number of lists.

| Step              | Cost                   |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| Each merge        | O(N) total             |
| Levels of merging | log K                  |
| **Total**         | `O(N log K)` ‚úÖ optimal |

---

## ‚úÖ How to Remember This?

üß† Here‚Äôs the **non-mugging** way to remember this:

### 1. **Analogy: It‚Äôs like Merge Sort**

* Don‚Äôt merge everything at once.
* Merge pairs, combine them level by level.

### 2. **Track Merge Intervals**

* Start with interval = 1
* Merge `lists[i]` with `lists[i + interval]`
* After every full pass, `interval *= 2`

### 3. **Think of the shape like a tree**

* Bottom-up merging
* Height is `log K`

## ‚úÖ Summary for Meta Interview

> ‚ÄúI use a divide-and-conquer approach, similar to merge sort. Instead of merging all k lists at once, I iteratively merge lists in pairs (L1+L2, L3+L4, etc.). This ensures that each merge is done in `O(N)` where `N` is the total number of nodes, and we only go `log K` levels deep, making the total time complexity `O(N log K)`. It‚Äôs more efficient than sequential merging (`O(KN)`).‚Äù
