Great question! You're using the **Boyer-Moore Majority Vote Algorithm** in this code, which is an optimal and classic method to find the **majority element** (the one that appears more than `n / 2` times in an array).

---

## ✅ Goal

Find the **majority element** in `O(n)` time and `O(1)` space.

---

## 🔍 What is the `count` variable doing?

### ✅ Telugu Explanation (Transliterated):

```java
int majority = num[0], count = 1;
```

* `majority` ante ee varaku unna elements lo most likely majority element idi ani assume chestunnam.
* `count` ante **current candidate ki support count** — ante how confident we are that `majority` is actually the majority element.

---

## ✅ How the Algorithm Works (with Comments)

```java
for (int i = 1; i < num.length; i++) {
    if (count == 0) {
        // 👇 count zero ayithe, new candidate ni consider cheyyali
        majority = num[i];
        count = 1;
    } else if (majority == num[i]) {
        // 👇 current number is same as candidate → count increase cheyyali
        count++;
    } else {
        // 👇 different number → candidate ki opposition vachesindi
        count--;
    }
}
```

---

## 🔁 Intuition:

Think of it like **voting**:

* If two different numbers cancel each other, only the **majority** survives because it occurs more than `n/2` times.
* `count` is the **net support** for the current `majority` candidate.

  * If we see same number → `count++`
  * If different → `count--`
  * If `count == 0` → we lose confidence and pick a new candidate.

Eventually, the **true majority element will survive** this cancellation process.

---

## ✅ Dry Run Example

```java
Input: [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]

Step-by-step:
Start: majority = 2, count = 1
2 → count++ = 2
1 → count-- = 1
1 → count-- = 0 (candidate reset)
1 → count = 1, majority = 1
2 → count-- = 0 (reset again)
2 → count = 1, majority = 2
```

✅ Final result: 2 (which appears 4 times > 7/2 = 3.5)

## ⏱ Time & Space Complexity

| Metric           | Value  |
| ---------------- | ------ |
| Time Complexity  | `O(n)` |
| Space Complexity | `O(1)` |

---

## ❗ Note:

This algorithm **only works when the majority element is guaranteed to exist**, as per the problem constraint.

---

Let me know if you want:

* A **verification pass** to confirm that the candidate is truly a majority.
* Or an **extension** for when majority is not guaranteed (i.e., return element > n/2 if it exists, else `-1`).
