Phone Screen
I was able to solve both problems during the phone screen. I did make a mistake while explaining the time complexity for one of the questions, but overall it went well and I moved on to the onsite loop. That made me feel confident that the core of my solutions and problem-solving approach were solid.

Coding Round 1
I answered both questions, but I needed quite a few hints from the interviewer. I was initially going in the wrong direction, but the interviewer was helpful and guided me back on track. By the end, both of my solutions worked, and the interviewer confirmed that. I’d consider this round a lean hire—I got to the correct solutions, but I wasn’t as independent as I’d like to have been.

Coding Round 2
Again, I solved both problems, but I was clumsy when walking through a test run for a recursive solution. I could tell the interviewer was a bit puzzled at one point, likely due to my explanation not being clear enough. I’m fairly certain my final solutions were correct, but this round might have come across as borderline—technically sound, but not communicated as well as it could have been.

System Design
The design question was a variation of a top-K problem, but framed around building something for a personal profile. I discussed Flink and Spark-based solutions and focused on how I’d handle real-time data. The interviewer asked me to explain how Flink does real-time processing and also asked for pseudocode. I could tell they were looking for a more implementation-level discussion. I think my answer showed that I understood the tools, but maybe not in the precise way they were expecting. My guess is this was a lean hire, possibly hire

Behavioral
This round was mostly situational questions. After each response, the interviewer said something like “that makes sense” and moved on. There wasn’t a lot of pushback or deep probing, so I take that as a sign that my answers were clear and acceptable, though probably not a strong signal either way.
