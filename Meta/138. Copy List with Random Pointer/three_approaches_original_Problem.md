Great! You have outlined **three valid approaches** for solving the “Copy List with Random Pointer” problem (LeetCode 138). Below is a **comparison and breakdown** of all three approaches — focusing only on:

* **Time and Space Complexity**
* **Key differences**
* **Interview talking points**
* **Which approach is preferred in interviews**

---

## ✅ **Approach 1: Recursive (with HashMap)**

### 🔹 Time Complexity:

* **O(N)** — Each node is visited once during recursion.

### 🔹 Space Complexity:

* **O(N)** — Due to:

  * Hash map for visited nodes.
  * **Call stack** because of recursion.

### 🔹 Key Points:

* Uses **DFS-style recursion**.
* Handles both `next` and `random` via two recursive calls.
* Needs extra space to store visited nodes.
* Not tail-recursive: could cause **stack overflow** for very large lists.

### 💬 Interview Talking Points:

* Conceptually simple and elegant.
* Good when interviewer values **recursion skills**.
* Showcases understanding of **object references and graph traversal**.
* Not optimal for large input due to recursion depth.

## ✅ **Approach 2: Iterative with O(N) Space**

### 🔹 Time Complexity:

* **O(N)** — Each node is visited exactly once.

### 🔹 Space Complexity:

* **O(N)** — Uses hash map (`visited`) to store original → clone mapping.

### 🔹 Key Points:

* Iterative version of the recursive idea.
* Separates the **getClonedNode** logic for clean code.
* Avoids recursion stack → **safe for large lists**.
* Easy to debug and intuitive.

### 💬 Interview Talking Points:

* Balanced solution — safe and clean.
* Excellent for production-quality code.
* Demonstrates understanding of **memoization** and handling shared/random references.
* Doesn’t mutate the original list — safe for concurrent systems.

## ✅ **Approach 3: Iterative with O(1) Space (In-Place Weaving)**

### 🔹 Time Complexity:

* **O(N)** — 3 linear passes:

  1. Clone nodes and weave them.
  2. Set `random` pointers.
  3. Unweave the original and cloned list.

### 🔹 Space Complexity:

* **O(1)** — No extra memory apart from output list. No hash map.

### 🔹 Key Points:

* Most **space-efficient** solution.
* Modifies the input list temporarily.
* Involves a **clever trick**: weaving original and cloned nodes.
* Tricky to implement and debug — more error-prone.

### 💬 Interview Talking Points:

* **Optimal** space usage: **O(1)**.
* Elegant but **non-trivial**; shows deep understanding.
* Strong choice when interviewer asks for **space optimization**.
* Mention that this approach **temporarily mutates the input**, but restores it.

## ✅ Summary Table

| Approach                | Time | Space              | Recursion | HashMap | Input Mutation | Talking Point          |
| ----------------------- | ---- | ------------------ | --------- | ------- | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| **1. Recursive**        | O(N) | O(N) (stack + map) | ✅ Yes     | ✅ Yes   | ❌ No           | Simple but stack-heavy |
| **2. Iterative (O(N))** | O(N) | O(N)               | ❌ No      | ✅ Yes   | ❌ No           | Clean, production-safe |
| **3. Iterative (O(1))** | O(N) | **O(1)**           | ❌ No      | ❌ No    | ✅ Yes          | Optimal, clever trick  |

## 🏆 Best Approach to Talk About in Interviews?

### ✅ Recommend **Approach 3** if:

* Asked to **optimize for space**
* Comfortable explaining pointer manipulation
* Want to showcase **algorithmic sharpness**

### ✅ Recommend **Approach 2** if:

* Interview values **clean, readable** solutions
* You want to show practical coding ability
* You are unsure if modifying input is acceptable

### 🔍 Keep **Approach 1** as a:

* Backup solution if recursion is preferred or to start simple
* Step to lead into iterative solution
