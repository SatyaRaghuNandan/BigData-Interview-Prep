Absolutely! Below are the **three updated Python implementations** for **"Copy List with Random Pointer" (Leetcode 138)** with:

* ✅ Clean variable naming
* ✅ Detailed Telugu comments in English script
* ✅ Explicit time and space complexity at the top of each approach

---

## ✅ Approach 1: Recursive with HashMap

```python
# ✅ Time Complexity: O(N)
# ✅ Space Complexity: O(N) - HashMap + Recursive Call Stack

class SolutionRecursive:
    def __init__(self):
        # 🗺️ Original node → Cloned node mapping maintain cheyyadam
        self.original_to_clone = {}

    def copyRandomList(self, head: 'Optional[Node]') -> 'Optional[Node]':
        # ⚠️ Base case: List lekapothe None return cheyyali
        if head is None:
            return None

        # 🟢 Already clone chesina node aithe, direct ga clone return cheyyadam
        if head in self.original_to_clone:
            return self.original_to_clone[head]

        # 🔵 New clone node create cheyyadam (random and next to be filled later)
        clone = Node(head.val, None, None)

        # 🔁 Mapping original → clone
        self.original_to_clone[head] = clone

        # 🔁 Recursive calls for next and random
        clone.next = self.copyRandomList(head.next)
        clone.random = self.copyRandomList(head.random)

        return clone
```

---

## ✅ Approach 2: Iterative with O(N) Space

```python
# ✅ Time Complexity: O(N)
# ✅ Space Complexity: O(N) - Only HashMap (no recursion)

class SolutionIterativeWithMap:
    def __init__(self):
        # 🗺️ Original → Clone map
        self.original_to_clone = {}

    def get_or_create_clone(self, node):
        # 🎯 Node ki corresponding clone return cheyyadam or create cheyyadam
        if node:
            if node in self.original_to_clone:
                return self.original_to_clone[node]
            clone = Node(node.val, None, None)
            self.original_to_clone[node] = clone
            return clone
        return None

    def copyRandomList(self, head: 'Optional[Node]') -> 'Optional[Node]':
        if head is None:
            return None

        current_original = head
        clone_head = Node(head.val, None, None)
        self.original_to_clone[current_original] = clone_head

        current_clone = clone_head

        # 🔁 List traverse cheyyadam while cloning
        while current_original:
            # 🔗 next and random pointers set cheyyadam
            current_clone.next = self.get_or_create_clone(current_original.next)
            current_clone.random = self.get_or_create_clone(current_original.random)

            # ⏩ Move to next node
            current_original = current_original.next
            current_clone = current_clone.next

        return clone_head
```

---

## ✅ Approach 3: Iterative with O(1) Space (Weaving Technique)

```python
# ✅ Time Complexity: O(N)
# ✅ Space Complexity: O(1) - No extra space other than output

class SolutionIterativeConstantSpace:
    def copyRandomList(self, head: 'Optional[Node]') -> 'Optional[Node]':
        if head is None:
            return None

        # Step 1: Cloning nodes and weaving (A → A' → B → B'...)
        current = head
        while current:
            new_node = Node(current.val, current.next, None)
            current.next = new_node
            current = new_node.next

        # Step 2: Setting random pointers for cloned nodes
        current = head
        while current:
            clone_node = current.next
            clone_node.random = current.random.next if current.random else None
            current = clone_node.next

        # Step 3: Unweaving original and cloned lists
        current_original = head
        clone_head = head.next
        current_clone = clone_head

        while current_original:
            current_original.next = current_clone.next
            current_clone.next = current_clone.next.next if current_clone.next else None

            current_original = current_original.next
            current_clone = current_clone.next

        return clone_head
```

Absolutely! The **iterative constant space solution** for `copyRandomList` is elegant but tricky to memorize. Let me give you:

---

### ✅ High-Level Analogy:

**Imagine you're making a shadow clone of each node and putting it right next to the original**—like:

```
Original: A → B → C
Weaved:   A → A' → B → B' → C → C'
```

Then, you **set the clone’s `random` pointer** by using the original node’s `random.next`.

Finally, **untangle** the mess into two separate linked lists.

---

### 🧠 Easy-to-Remember 3-Step Formula

#### 🔵 Step 1: **Weave** the Clones

> Insert a cloned node right next to each original.

```python
A → A' → B → B' → C → C'
```

#### 🔴 Step 2: **Wire Up** `random` Pointers

> If `A.random = C`, then `A'.random = A.random.next` → `C'`.

```python
clone.random = original.random.next
```

#### 🟢 Step 3: **Unweave** the Two Lists

> Split the original and clone chains cleanly.

```python
A → B → C         (original)
A' → B' → C'      (cloned)
```

---

### 🎯 Memorization Tip (For Interviews)

Think of the **3Ws**:

1. **W**eave (`next` pointers for clone)
2. **W**ire (`random` pointers using original.random.next)
3. **W**eave Out (restore original, separate clone)

⏬ Mnemonic:

> **“Weave – Wire – Weave Out”**

### ✅ Time & Space Complexity

| Metric | Value                   |
| ------ | ----------------------- |
| Time   | O(N)                    |
| Space  | O(1) (excluding output) |

No hash maps used — all logic is in-place by piggybacking off `next` pointers.

### ✅ Why Meta Likes This:

* Efficient use of in-place pointers.
* Avoids extra space.
* Shows understanding of pointer manipulation and linked list invariants.
* Strong signal of algorithmic maturity.
