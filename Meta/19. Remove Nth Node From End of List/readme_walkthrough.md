Let's walk through your code for the problem **"Remove Nth Node from End of List"**, line by line, using the example:

---

### ✅ **Test Case**

Input:
`head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
`n = 2`

Goal:
Remove the **2nd node from the end**, which is node `4`.

---

### ✅ Step-by-Step Execution

#### Initial Linked List:

```
1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
```

We are asked to remove the 2nd node from the end → That is `4`.

---

### 🧠 Step 1: Create a Dummy Node

```java
ListNode dummyNode = new ListNode(0);
dummyNode.next = head;
```

* Dummy node will point to head:

```
dummyNode(0) → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
```

This helps in edge cases (e.g., when the head itself needs to be removed).

---

### 🧠 Step 2: Initialize `fastPointer` and `slowPointer` on dummy

```java
ListNode fastPointer = dummyNode;
ListNode slowPointer = dummyNode;
```

Pointers setup:

```
fastPointer: dummyNode(0)
slowPointer: dummyNode(0)
```

---

### 🧠 Step 3: Move `fastPointer` n steps ahead

```java
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    fastPointer = fastPointer.next;
}
```

We move `fastPointer` ahead by 2 steps:

* Step 1 → `fastPointer = 1`
* Step 2 → `fastPointer = 2`

Now:

```
fastPointer: 2
slowPointer: 0 (dummy)
```

---

### 🧠 Step 4: Move both pointers until `fastPointer.next == null`

```java
while (fastPointer.next != null) {
    fastPointer = fastPointer.next;
    slowPointer = slowPointer.next;
}
```

We loop:

1. `fastPointer = 3`, `slowPointer = 1`
2. `fastPointer = 4`, `slowPointer = 2`
3. `fastPointer = 5`, `slowPointer = 3`

Now `fastPointer.next == null`, so we **stop** the loop.

---

### 🧠 Step 5: Remove the nth node

```java
slowPointer.next = slowPointer.next.next;
```

* `slowPointer = 3`
* `slowPointer.next = 4` → This is the node to be deleted
* `slowPointer.next.next = 5`

So we skip `4`:

```
3 → 5
```

Updated list:

```
1 → 2 → 3 → 5
```

---

### 🧠 Step 6: Return the updated list

```java
return dummyNode.next;
```

* Since we used a dummy node, `dummyNode.next` is still pointing to the original head.
* But now `3` is connected directly to `5`.

---

### ✅ Final Output:

```
1 → 2 → 3 → 5
```

### 🕵️‍♂️ Dry Run Recap Table

| Step   | fastPointer | slowPointer | Action                        |
| ------ | ----------- | ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| Init   | 0 (dummy)   | 0 (dummy)   | Set both on dummy             |
| +1     | 1           | 0           | fastPointer moved 1 step      |
| +2     | 2           | 0           | fastPointer moved 2 steps     |
| Loop   | 3           | 1           | Move both                     |
| Loop   | 4           | 2           | Move both                     |
| Loop   | 5           | 3           | Move both                     |
| Delete | -           | 3           | Delete `slowPointer.next = 4` |

---

### ✅ Time and Space Complexity

| Complexity | Value                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Time       | O(L) where L = number of nodes (we traverse list once) |
| Space      | O(1) constant space used                               |

Let me know if you want another test case like:

* Removing the **head**
* Removing the **last node**
* Removing from a list of only **1 node**

I'll walk that too.
