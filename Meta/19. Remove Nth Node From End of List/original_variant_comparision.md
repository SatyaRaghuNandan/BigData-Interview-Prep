That’s a great observation, and this comparison can help you **intuitively remember** the difference between:

### 🔁 `removeNthFromBeginning` (Simple Forward Skip)

vs

### 🔁 `removeNthFromEnd` (Two-Pointer + Gap)

Let’s break it down clearly so you’ll **never forget**:

---

## ✅ 1. `removeNthFromBeginning`

### 🧠 What you're doing:

You already **know the position from the start**. So:

* Just walk `n-1` steps forward
* Skip the `n`th node by updating `current.next`

### 🟢 Why it’s Simple?

Because you’re directly using the index (`0-based` after dummy).
No need to traverse the full list or calculate length dynamically.

### 💡 Key Line:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) current = current.next;
```

---

## ✅ 2. `removeNthFromEnd`

### 🤔 Why is this trickier?

You **don't know** how long the list is.

To remove the `n`th node from **end**, you must:

* Know how far it is from the **start**
* But you **don’t know the length** beforehand

### 💡 Clever Trick: Two Pointers (with a gap of `n` steps)

1. Move `fast` pointer `n` steps ahead.
2. Move both `fast` and `slow` until `fast` hits the end.
3. Now, `slow.next` is the node to be removed.

This works in **one pass**, even without knowing the list's length!

## 🧠 How to Remember This?

Here’s a mental **hook** to differentiate and remember:

| Variant                  | Clue / Analogy                                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `removeNthFromBeginning` | "Index based" → Easy skip using direct count (like array)     |
| `removeNthFromEnd`       | "Blindfolded" → Need helper (2nd pointer) to count indirectly |
|                          | Think: **Fast car goes first, slow catches up**               |

> 🎯 **Memory Tip**:
>
> * “From Beginning” = Count and skip
> * “From End” = Two pointers create a "window" of size `n`

## 🧪 Dry Run (Same Input): `head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

### `removeNthFromBeginning(head, 3)`

* Dummy → 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
* Move to `2` (`n-1 = 2` steps)
* Skip `3` → link `2 -> 4`
* ✅ Output = `[1, 2, 4, 5]`

---

### `removeNthFromEnd(head, 3)`

* Want to remove **3rd node from end** → same as above
* Two pointers with gap of 3
* Result: Remove node `3`
* ✅ Output = `[1, 2, 4, 5]`

➡️ **Same result**, but logic is different because you don't know the length in `removeNthFromEnd`.

## 🏁 Summary Table

| Feature                       | From Beginning | From End                      |
| ----------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Input position is direct?     | ✅ Yes          | ❌ No                          |
| Need to know full length?     | ❌ No           | ❌ No (due to 2-pointer trick) |
| One-pass solution?            | ✅ Yes          | ✅ Yes                         |
| Simpler implementation?       | ✅ Slightly     | ❌ Needs pointer gap logic     |
| Can use array-style thinking? | ✅ Yes          | ❌ Must simulate end counting  |
