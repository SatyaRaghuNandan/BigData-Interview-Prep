Absolutely! Let‚Äôs break it into two approaches:

---

## ‚úÖ Approach 1: **Better** ‚Äì Group by Shift Pattern (Difference String)

This is a **slightly less optimized but still correct** solution based on calculating **relative differences** between adjacent characters.

### üî∏ How it works:

Instead of normalizing to `'a'`, you store the **difference pattern** between adjacent characters as the key.

### üîπ 4 Key Points to Remember:

1. **Build key using char gaps**: For each string, compute the difference between each pair of adjacent characters `(char[i] - char[i-1] + 26) % 26`.
2. **Use a HashMap**: Key is the difference pattern like `"1_1"` for `"abc"`; Value is a list of strings.
3. **Group strings**: All strings with the same key go into the same group.
4. **Example**:

   * `"abc"` ‚Üí `"1_1"`
   * `"bcd"` ‚Üí `"1_1"`
     So, grouped together.

---

## üåü Approach 2: **Best (Optimal & Preferred for Interview)** ‚Äì Normalize by Shifting to 'a'

### üî∏ Why it‚Äôs better:

* Simpler, cleaner, and avoids pattern construction logic.
* Easier to **explain and debug** during interviews.
* Deterministic mapping: always maps to a consistent form (like `"abc"`).

---

### ‚úÖ 6 Key Points ‚Äì **Best Approach: Normalize to 'a'**

1. **Goal**: Make all strings with the same shifting pattern look the same by shifting their first character to `'a'` and adjusting others accordingly.

2. **Shift Amount**: For each string, calculate `shift = input.charAt(0) - 'a'`.

3. **Normalize Each Character**:

   * Subtract shift from each character.
   * If result < `'a'`, wrap around by adding 26.

4. **Build Normalized String as Key**:

   * Example: `"bcd"` ‚Üí `"abc"`, `"xyz"` ‚Üí `"abc"` ‚Üí both go into the same group.

5. **Use HashMap to Group**:

   * `Map<normalized_string, List<String>>` to collect original strings by group.

6. **Return All Grouped Values**:

   * Final result is `new ArrayList<>(map.values())`.

---

### üî• Why Use the Best One in Interview:

* ‚úÖ Very **intuitive to explain** (just shift all to align with `'a'`)
* ‚úÖ Easy to **code and debug**
* ‚úÖ Performs well with clean O(N¬∑L) time and space
* ‚úÖ Robust against edge cases (e.g., single-letter strings, wrap-arounds like `'z' ‚Üí 'a'`)

## ‚úÖ Problem: LeetCode 249 ‚Äì Group Shifted Strings

Given a list of strings, group all strings that belong to the **same shifting sequence**.

A shifting sequence is defined such that:

* Each letter in one string can be **shifted forward** by the same number of positions to become another string.
* Wrap around `'z' ‚Üí 'a'` is allowed.

---

## ‚úÖ Example

**Input**:

```
["abc", "bcd", "xyz", "az", "ba", "acef", "a", "z"]
```

**Output**:

```
[
  ["abc", "bcd", "xyz"],
  ["az", "ba"],
  ["acef"],
  ["a", "z"]
]
```

## ‚úÖ Java Code (Clean & Interview-Ready)

```java
import java.util.*;

public class GroupShiftedStrings {

    public List<List<String>> groupStrings(String[] strings) {
        Map<String, List<String>> map = new HashMap<>();

        for (String s : strings) {
            String key = getShiftKey(s); // Normalize each string
            map.computeIfAbsent(key, k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(s);
        }

        return new ArrayList<>(map.values());
    }

    // Normalize the string by shifting first character to 'a' and adjusting others
    private String getShiftKey(String s) {
        StringBuilder key = new StringBuilder();
        int shift = s.charAt(0) - 'a';

        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            int normalized = c - shift;
            if (normalized < 'a') {
                normalized += 26; // Wrap around if below 'a'
            }
            key.append((char) normalized);
        }

        return key.toString();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        GroupShiftedStrings sol = new GroupShiftedStrings();
        String[] input = {"abc", "bcd", "xyz", "az", "ba", "acef", "a", "z"};

        List<List<String>> result = sol.groupStrings(input);

        for (List<String> group : result) {
            System.out.println(group);
        }
    }
}
```

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Explanation

### üîπ Goal:

Group strings like `"abc" ‚Üí "bcd" ‚Üí "cde"` because all of them shift each character by the same amount.

---

### üîπ What is the "key"?

To detect if two strings belong to the same shifting group:

* Treat the first character of the string as `'a'`
* Shift all characters relative to that
* Handle wrap-around using `(char - shift + 26) % 26`

So:

* `"abc"` ‚Üí normalize to `"abc"` (no shift)
* `"bcd"` ‚Üí normalize to `"abc"` (shifted by 1)
* `"xyz"` ‚Üí normalize to `"abc"` (shifted by 23)

They all belong to the same group.

## ‚úÖ Dry Run

Input: `["abc", "bcd", "xyz", "az", "ba", "acef", "a", "z"]`

1. `"abc"` ‚Üí normalized to `"abc"` ‚Üí group 1
2. `"bcd"` ‚Üí normalized to `"abc"` ‚Üí group 1
3. `"xyz"` ‚Üí normalized to `"abc"` ‚Üí group 1
4. `"az"` ‚Üí normalized to `"az"` ‚Üí group 2
5. `"ba"` ‚Üí normalized to `"az"` ‚Üí group 2
6. `"acef"` ‚Üí normalized to `"acef"` ‚Üí group 3
7. `"a"` ‚Üí normalized to `"a"` ‚Üí group 4
8. `"z"` ‚Üí normalized to `"a"` ‚Üí group 4

---

## ‚úÖ Output

```
[
  ["abc", "bcd", "xyz"],
  ["az", "ba"],
  ["acef"],
  ["a", "z"]
]
```

## ‚úÖ Interview Tip

> ‚ÄúTo group shifted strings, I normalize each string by shifting it so the first character becomes `'a'`. This gives me a unique signature for each shifting group. I use a HashMap to group strings by this normalized key.‚Äù

To easily remember the solution for **Leetcode 249: Group Shifted Strings**, you can break it into **5 easy-to-remember steps**. This problem is like grouping anagrams ‚Äî **but based on shift patterns** (e.g., `"abc" -> "bcd" -> "cde"` all have same relative character difference).

---

### ‚úÖ Problem Summary

Group strings that belong to the **same shifting sequence**.
For example:
`["abc", "bcd", "acef", "xyz", "az", "ba", "a", "z"]` ‚Üí group strings that can be shifted to match each other.

---

### ‚úÖ 5-Step Approach to Remember the Solution:

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Understand the concept of "shifting group"**

* All strings in a group have the **same letter-to-letter difference** between characters.
* Example:

  * `"abc"` ‚Üí `'b'-'a' = 1`, `'c'-'b' = 1`
  * `"bcd"` ‚Üí `'c'-'b' = 1`, `'d'-'c' = 1`
  * They match.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Use normalization via shifting to 'a'**

* Convert every string so that its **first character becomes 'a'** by subtracting the shift.
* `"bcd"` becomes `"abc"`, `"xyz"` becomes `"abc"`, so they map to same normalized key.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Use a HashMap to group by the normalized key**

* Key: normalized string (e.g., `"abc"` for `"bcd"` and `"xyz"`)
* Value: list of original strings with same normalized key.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Edge case: shift wraps around**

* When subtracting, if the character goes before `'a'`, add 26.
* `'a' - 1 = '`'`‚Üí needs fix ‚Üí`'z' + 1`=`'a'\`.

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Build final result from map values**

* Each list in map represents a valid group.

### üîÅ How to Memorize the Normalization Function (`getShiftKey`)

```java
int shift = input.charAt(0) - 'a'; // how much to shift to make first char 'a'
for (char c : input.toCharArray()) {
    int normalized = c - shift;
    if (normalized < 'a') normalized += 26;
    builder.append((char) normalized);
}
```

üìå **Trick**: Always shift first letter to `'a'`, adjust others accordingly.

---

### üß† Mnemonic to Remember:

> **"Group by shape after sliding to 'a'"**

* **"Shape"** = normalized form.
* **"Sliding to 'a'"** = make the first character of each string `'a'` by subtracting shift.

---

### ‚è± Time and Space Complexity

| Complexity | Value                                        |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Time       | `O(N * L)` ‚Äî N = num strings, L = avg length |
| Space      | `O(N * L)` ‚Äî storing groups in HashMap       |
