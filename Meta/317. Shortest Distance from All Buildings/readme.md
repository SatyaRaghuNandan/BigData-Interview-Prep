Absolutely! Let's walk through the **multiple approaches** to the **Leetcode 317: Shortest Distance from All Buildings** problem in **plain English**, then go deep into the **best approach** with:

* ‚úÖ Python + Java code with Telugu comments
* ‚úÖ Time & Space complexity
* ‚úÖ Dry run example
* ‚úÖ Edge test cases

---

## ‚úÖ Problem Summary (Plain English)

You are given a 2D grid where:

* `1` represents **buildings**
* `0` represents **empty land**
* `2` represents **obstacles**

You must choose **one empty land** such that:

* The **sum of shortest distances** from that land to **all buildings** is minimized.
* You can only move **up/down/left/right**.

If no such empty land exists that can reach all buildings, return `-1`.

---

## ‚úÖ Multiple Approaches (Plain English)

### üü¢ Approach 1: Brute Force (Not Preferred)

* Try placing a house on every empty cell.
* From that cell, do BFS to calculate distance to every building.
* Repeat for all empty cells.
* ‚ùå Time Complexity: `O(Z √ó B √ó N √ó M)` ‚Üí very slow

---

### üü¢ Approach 2: BFS from Empty Cells (Flawed)

* Try to do BFS from empty cells to buildings.
* ‚ùå Problem: you don‚Äôt know **where all buildings are** in one pass
* ‚ùå May re-traverse or overcount paths

---

### ‚úÖ **Approach 3: BFS from Every Building (Best)**

* For every building (`1`), run BFS to update:

  * `total_dist[r][c]`: sum of distances from all buildings
  * `reach_count[r][c]`: how many buildings reached this cell
* At the end, choose the minimum `total_dist` where `reach_count == total buildings`

‚úÖ Efficient
‚úÖ Interview-friendly
‚úÖ Easy to debug/extend
‚úÖ BFS guarantees shortest paths in uniform-cost grids

## ‚úÖ BEST APPROACH: BFS FROM EACH BUILDING

                                grid[nx][ny] == 0 and not visited[nx][ny]):

                                # Ee cell ni ee building reach chesindi
                                visited[nx][ny] = True
                                total_dist[nx][ny] += dist + 1
                                reach[nx][ny] += 1
                                q.append((nx, ny, dist + 1))

        # Final step lo: anni buildings reach chesina 0 cells ni consider cheyyali

| -------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| üïí Time  | `O(B * R * C)` = `O(N¬≤ * M¬≤)` | BFS from each building across all empty lands        |
| üß† Space | `O(R * C)`                    | distance\[]\[] + reach\[]\[] + visited\[]\[] + queue |

## ‚úÖ Dry Run Example

### Grid:

```
[1, 0, 2, 0, 1]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 2, 0, 2, 0]
```

* Buildings at `(0,0)` and `(0,4)`
* Obstacles at `(0,2)`, `(2,1)`, `(2,3)`
* Empty lands: All other `0`s

---

### Steps:

* BFS from (0,0): update all reachable empty lands with distance
* BFS from (0,4): update same cells
* Final pass: only keep empty lands reachable from **both buildings**

üëâ Final output: `7` (optimal house is at `(1,2)`)

---

## ‚úÖ Test Scenarios

### ‚úÖ Case 1: Basic Working Case

```python
grid = [
 [1, 0, 2, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 2, 0, 2, 0]
]
# Output: 7
```

---

### ‚úÖ Case 2: All Obstacles Block Buildings

```python
grid = [
 [1, 2, 0],
 [2, 2, 2],
 [0, 2, 1]
]
# Output: -1 (no empty land can reach both buildings)
```

---

### ‚úÖ Case 3: Only One Building

```python
grid = [
 [1, 0],
 [0, 0]
]
# Output: 1 (build at (0,1) or (1,0))
```
