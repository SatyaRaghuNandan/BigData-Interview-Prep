Absolutely! Let's walk through the **multiple approaches** to the **Leetcode 317: Shortest Distance from All Buildings** problem in **plain English**, then go deep into the **best approach** with:

* ‚úÖ Python + Java code with Telugu comments
* ‚úÖ Time & Space complexity
* ‚úÖ Dry run example
* ‚úÖ Edge test cases

---

## ‚úÖ Problem Summary (Plain English)

You are given a 2D grid where:

* `1` represents **buildings**
* `0` represents **empty land**
* `2` represents **obstacles**

You must choose **one empty land** such that:

* The **sum of shortest distances** from that land to **all buildings** is minimized.
* You can only move **up/down/left/right**.

If no such empty land exists that can reach all buildings, return `-1`.

---

## ‚úÖ Multiple Approaches (Plain English)

### üü¢ Approach 1: Brute Force (Not Preferred)

* Try placing a house on every empty cell.
* From that cell, do BFS to calculate distance to every building.
* Repeat for all empty cells.
* ‚ùå Time Complexity: `O(Z √ó B √ó N √ó M)` ‚Üí very slow

---

### üü¢ Approach 2: BFS from Empty Cells (Flawed)

* Try to do BFS from empty cells to buildings.
* ‚ùå Problem: you don‚Äôt know **where all buildings are** in one pass
* ‚ùå May re-traverse or overcount paths

---

### ‚úÖ **Approach 3: BFS from Every Building (Best)**

* For every building (`1`), run BFS to update:

  * `total_dist[r][c]`: sum of distances from all buildings
  * `reach_count[r][c]`: how many buildings reached this cell
* At the end, choose the minimum `total_dist` where `reach_count == total buildings`

‚úÖ Efficient
‚úÖ Interview-friendly
‚úÖ Easy to debug/extend
‚úÖ BFS guarantees shortest paths in uniform-cost grids

---

## ‚úÖ BEST APPROACH: BFS FROM EACH BUILDING

---

You're right! Here's the **same updated version** of the code with:

‚úÖ `is_valid()` helper
‚úÖ Clean variable names
‚úÖ ‚úçÔ∏è Telugu-style comments (in English script)

---

### ‚úÖ Final Python Code with Telugu Comments and `is_valid()` Function

Absolutely! Here's a concise **plan (pointers)** for this approach to **‚ÄúShortest Distance from All Buildings‚Äù**:

---

### ‚úÖ Problem Plan: BFS from Each Building

#### **1. Count total number of buildings**

* Iterate through the grid.
* Count how many cells have value `1`.

---

#### **2. Initialize two helper grids:**

* `dist_sum[i][j]`: Sum of distances from cell `(i, j)` to all buildings.
* `reach_count[i][j]`: Number of buildings that cell `(i, j)` can reach.

---

#### **3. For each building (cell with `1`), perform BFS:**

* Track `visited[][]` to avoid revisiting.
* Use BFS to expand from that building to all reachable empty lands (`0`).
* For each reachable cell:

  * Update its `dist_sum` by adding the distance.
  * Increment its `reach_count`.

---

#### **4. After all BFS runs:**

* Check each empty land cell (`0`):

  * If `reach_count[i][j] == total_buildings`, it means this land is reachable from **all buildings**.
  * Among such valid cells, find the minimum `dist_sum`.

---

#### **5. Final result:**

* Return the **minimum distance sum**.
* If no such valid empty land exists, return `-1`.

```

### üìä Time & Space Complexity:

#### ‚è± Time Complexity: `O(B √ó m √ó n)`

* `B` = Number of buildings
* For every building we do `BFS` across `m √ó n` grid ‚Üí total time = **O(B √ó m √ó n)**

#### üíæ Space Complexity: `O(m √ó n)`

* `dist_sum`, `reach_count`, `visited` arrays are all `O(m √ó n)`
* `queue` in BFS can grow up to `O(m √ó n)`

## ‚úÖ Dry Run Example

### Grid:

```
[1, 0, 2, 0, 1]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 2, 0, 2, 0]
```

* Buildings at `(0,0)` and `(0,4)`
* Obstacles at `(0,2)`, `(2,1)`, `(2,3)`
* Empty lands: All other `0`s

---

### Steps:

* BFS from (0,0): update all reachable empty lands with distance
* BFS from (0,4): update same cells
* Final pass: only keep empty lands reachable from **both buildings**

üëâ Final output: `7` (optimal house is at `(1,2)`)

---

## ‚úÖ Test Scenarios

### ‚úÖ Case 1: Basic Working Case

```python
grid = [
 [1, 0, 2, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 2, 0, 2, 0]
]
# Output: 7
```

---

### ‚úÖ Case 2: All Obstacles Block Buildings

```python
grid = [
 [1, 2, 0],
 [2, 2, 2],
 [0, 2, 1]
]
# Output: -1 (no empty land can reach both buildings)
```

---

### ‚úÖ Case 3: Only One Building

```python
grid = [
 [1, 0],
 [0, 0]
]
# Output: 1 (build at (0,1) or (1,0))
```
