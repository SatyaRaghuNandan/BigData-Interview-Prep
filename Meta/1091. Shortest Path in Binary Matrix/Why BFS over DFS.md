Excellent follow-up — this is exactly the type of question that **impresses interviewers** when you're able to reason clearly.

## ✅ Why **BFS is Better than DFS** for This Problem:

### 🔍 Problem Goal:

> **Find the shortest path** in a binary matrix from the top-left to bottom-right using 8-direction movement.

That’s key: You need the **minimum number of steps**, not **all paths**.

---

## 🔥 Reason 1: BFS Guarantees the **Shortest Path First**

* BFS explores level-by-level (or layer-by-layer), starting from distance `1`, then `2`, then `3`, and so on.
* As soon as you reach the destination, you are guaranteed it was reached via the **fewest possible steps**.

🟢 **Example**:

```
Start at (0,0), distance = 1
Next level: All neighbors (distance = 2)
Next: Neighbors of neighbors (distance = 3)
...
```

### 🔁 First time you reach destination = shortest path.

---

## 🔥 Reason 2: DFS Explores Deep but Not Optimal

* DFS dives deep into one path without checking if it's the shortest.
* You have to **explore all possible paths**, keeping track of the **minimum path length manually**, which adds:

  * Extra space for recursion
  * Backtracking logic
  * Risk of revisiting nodes inefficiently

❌ So DFS:

* Cannot guarantee shortest path first
* Needs pruning or memoization
* Can hit **stack overflow** for deep paths (`O(N^2)` depth)

| Criteria                  | BFS          | DFS                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------- |
| Guarantees shortest path  | ✅ Yes        | ❌ No                        |
| Natural for shortest path | ✅ Yes        | ❌ Must track manually       |
| Time complexity           | ✅ `O(N^2)`   | ❌ Worse due to backtracking |
| Space complexity          | ✅ `O(N^2)`   | ❌ Can hit stack overflow    |
| Suitable for this problem | ✅ Absolutely | ❌ Not recommended           |

## 🧠 In Interviews, Say This:

> *“Since we’re looking for the **shortest path** in an unweighted graph, I chose **BFS**. It guarantees that the first time we reach the destination, we’ve done so with the minimal number of steps. DFS doesn’t guarantee this unless we explore all paths, which is inefficient here.”*

Let me know if you'd like to see a **DFS version** for learning purposes or want to understand **when DFS would be better** in other scenarios.
