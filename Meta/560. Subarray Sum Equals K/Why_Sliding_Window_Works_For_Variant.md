Excellent question. The **core difference** lies in the **nature of the input** ‚Äî specifically, whether the numbers are **only positive** or if they can be **negative/zero** as well.

Let‚Äôs break this down clearly:

## ‚úÖ Why Sliding Window Works in the Variant (Positive Numbers Only)

### üîπ In This Variant:

* **All elements are positive**: `nums[i] > 0`
* When we increase the window by moving `right`, the `window_sum` **only increases**.
* When we move `left`, we reduce the window and hence decrease the sum.

### üí° So:

* The `window_sum` behaves **monotonically** with the window size:

  * ‚ûï Add more elements ‚Üí sum increases
  * ‚ûñ Remove elements from start ‚Üí sum decreases

‚û°Ô∏è This **predictable behavior** makes it ideal for the **sliding window** technique.

## ‚ùå Why Sliding Window Fails in the Original Problem

### üîπ In the Original Problem:

* `nums` can have **positive, negative, or zero** values.
* So, `window_sum` can:

  * Increase
  * Decrease
  * Stay the same
* You can‚Äôt shrink the window from left just because `window_sum > k` ‚Äî because subtracting a **negative number** may **increase** the sum again!

### üí• Example Where Sliding Window Fails:

```python
nums = [-1, 2, 3, -4], k = 0
```

No way to predictably shrink window ‚Äî so **sliding window fails**.

## üß† Therefore...

| Feature                   | Variant (Positive)         | Original (Any Integers)       |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Input                     | All `nums[i] > 0`          | Can be negative/zero/positive |
| Behavior of sum           | Monotonic (increases only) | Unpredictable                 |
| Shrinking window (left++) | Safe, reduces sum          | Unsafe, may increase sum      |
| Strategy                  | Sliding Window             | Prefix Sum + HashMap (or Set) |
| Time Complexity           | O(n)                       | O(n)                          |
| Space Complexity          | O(1)                       | O(n)                          |

### ‚úÖ Summary:

* We used **sliding window** in the variant because it‚Äôs **fast**, **space-efficient**, and works **only if all numbers are positive**.
* For the **general case**, we need **prefix sums + set/map** to handle unpredictable behavior due to negative numbers.

Let me know if you‚Äôd like a unified approach that works for both cases or want a follow-up like ‚Äúprint the subarray.‚Äù
