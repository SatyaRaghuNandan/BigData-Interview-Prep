Yes ‚Äî you're absolutely right. The **recursive side-effect cascade** makes the variant look complex at first glance. But let‚Äôs simplify.

## ‚úÖ Step Back: What‚Äôs the Core Idea?

You're solving a **chain reaction** version of:

> "Remove adjacent duplicates as you iterate from left to right. After a deletion, restart checking."

So this is **not** just a one-pass greedy ‚Äî it‚Äôs like **repeating** LeetCode 1047 until **no changes happen**.

## ‚úÖ Simpler and Clean Solution Strategy

### ‚úÖ Use a Standard Stack Approach ‚Äî But Clean Up Recursively or Iteratively

Here‚Äôs how to keep it **simple and clean**:

---

### ‚úÖ Python (Elegant Iterative Stack + While Loop)

```python
def remove_all_adjacent_duplicates(s: str) -> str:
    changed = True

    while changed:
        stack = []
        changed = False

        for ch in s:
            if stack and stack[-1] == ch:
                changed = True
                while stack and stack[-1] == ch:
                    stack.pop()  # remove the duplicate group
            else:
                stack.append(ch)

        s = ''.join(stack)

    return s
```

### üß† Key Insight:

* You **repeat** the basic adjacent duplicate removal **until the string stops changing**.
* The stack clears duplicates as it finds them.
* Each pass removes at least one duplicate group ‚Üí **at most O(N) passes**.

---

### ‚úÖ Time and Space Complexity

* **Time Complexity:**

  * Worst-case: `O(N^2)` when input string is like `"aaaaaaaaaa"` and shrinks by 1 each time.
  * Average-case (in practice): **linear or near-linear**.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(N)` due to stack.

---

### ‚úÖ Cleaner than Tracking Frequencies or Custom Structs

Unlike the `letter {char, freq}` approach in C++:

* ‚úÖ No custom class needed.
* ‚úÖ No frequency tracking.
* ‚úÖ Logic is simpler, and easier to understand/debug.
* ‚úÖ You can easily adapt it to `k` variant.

---

## üîÅ Generalizing to k-Adjacent Duplicates

If you're solving:

> "Remove all adjacent duplicates of **length k**"

Just count while pushing to the stack:

### ‚úÖ Python: K-Duplicate Removal

```python
def remove_duplicates_k(s: str, k: int) -> str:
    stack = []  # Each element is (char, count)

    for ch in s:
        if stack and stack[-1][0] == ch:
            stack[-1][1] += 1
            if stack[-1][1] == k:
                stack.pop()  # remove the group
        else:
            stack.append([ch, 1])

    return ''.join(char * count for char, count in stack)
```

## ‚úÖ Final Thoughts

| Variant                          | Best Approach               | Simplicity | Performance          |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------- |
| Basic Adjacent Duplicate Removal | Stack + One Pass            | ‚úÖ Simple   | ‚úÖ Fast               |
| Cascading Duplicate Removal      | Stack + While Loop          | ‚úÖ Simple   | ‚ö†Ô∏è Potentially O(N¬≤) |
| K-Adjacent Duplicates            | Stack + Count Tracking      | ‚úÖ Clean    | ‚úÖ Fast               |
| Nested + Recursively Emerging    | Recursive DFS or While Loop | ‚ö†Ô∏è Complex | ‚ö†Ô∏è Slowest           |

Let me know which one you want in Java or want to combine both `k` and cascading logic together.
