## ‚úÖ 1011. Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days

### üìå Problem Summary

> Given weights of packages and a number of days `D`, find the **minimum ship capacity** such that all packages can be shipped in `D` days. You must ship packages in order.

---

### üí° Approach

* Binary search on capacity: search range is `[max(weights), sum(weights)]`
* For each mid value (guessed capacity), check if we can ship within `D` days
* Use greedy check to simulate the days needed

---

### ‚úÖ Java Code

```java
class ShipPackages {
    public int shipWithinDays(int[] weights, int D) {
        int left = Arrays.stream(weights).max().getAsInt();
        int right = Arrays.stream(weights).sum();

        while (left < right) {
            int mid = (left + right) / 2;
            if (canShip(weights, D, mid)) right = mid;
            else left = mid + 1;
        }
        return left;
    }

    private boolean canShip(int[] weights, int D, int capacity) {
        int days = 1, total = 0;
        for (int w : weights) {
            total += w;
            if (total > capacity) {
                days++;
                total = w;
                if (days > D) return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

## ‚úÖ 875. Koko Eating Bananas

### üìå Problem Summary

> Koko can eat at a fixed speed (bananas/hour). Given piles of bananas and `H` hours, find the **minimum eating speed** required to finish all bananas in time.

---

### üí° Approach

* Binary search over speed from `[1, max(piles)]`
* For each speed, check if total eating time ‚â§ H
* Use `Math.ceil(pile / speed)` to compute hours per pile

---

### ‚úÖ Java Code

```java
class KokoBananas {
    public int minEatingSpeed(int[] piles, int H) {
        int left = 1, right = Arrays.stream(piles).max().getAsInt();
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = (left + right) / 2;
            if (canFinish(piles, H, mid)) right = mid;
            else left = mid + 1;
        }
        return left;
    }

    private boolean canFinish(int[] piles, int H, int speed) {
        int hours = 0;
        for (int pile : piles)
            hours += (pile + speed - 1) / speed;
        return hours <= H;
    }
}
```

## ‚úÖ 1482. Minimum Days to Make m Bouquets

### üìå Problem Summary

> Given `bloomDay[]`, find the **minimum day** such that you can make `m` bouquets using `k` consecutive flowers each.

---

### üí° Approach

* Binary search on day in `[min(bloomDay), max(bloomDay)]`
* On each guess, check how many bouquets can be made with that day as limit
* Reset count if you hit an unbloomed flower

---

### ‚úÖ Java Code

```java
class MinimumDaysBouquets {
    public int minDays(int[] bloomDay, int m, int k) {
        if ((long) m * k > bloomDay.length) return -1;
        int left = Arrays.stream(bloomDay).min().getAsInt();
        int right = Arrays.stream(bloomDay).max().getAsInt();

        while (left < right) {
            int mid = (left + right) / 2;
            if (canMake(bloomDay, m, k, mid)) right = mid;
            else left = mid + 1;
        }
        return left;
    }

    private boolean canMake(int[] bloomDay, int m, int k, int days) {
        int count = 0, bouquets = 0;
        for (int bloom : bloomDay) {
            if (bloom <= days) {
                count++;
                if (count == k) {
                    bouquets++;
                    count = 0;
                }
            } else {
                count = 0;
            }

        return bouquets >= m;

## ‚úÖ 1891. Cutting Ribbons

### üìå Problem Summary

> You are given ribbons and want to cut them into equal lengths. Find the **maximum length** such that you get at least `k` pieces.

---

### üí° Approach

* Binary search on length from `[1, max(ribbons)]`
* Check how many pieces can be formed with current length guess
* Maximize result when feasible

---

### ‚úÖ Java Code

```java
class CuttingRibbons {
    public int maxLength(int[] ribbons, int k) {
        int left = 1, right = Arrays.stream(ribbons).max().getAsInt(), res = 0;

        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = (left + right) / 2;
            if (canCut(ribbons, k, mid)) {
                res = mid;
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }

    private boolean canCut(int[] ribbons, int k, int length) {
        int count = 0;
