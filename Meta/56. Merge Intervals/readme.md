You're implementing the classic **Merge Intervals** problem — very efficiently — and you're asking for:

✅ Telugu-style comments (transliterated in English)
✅ Detailed test cases and edge case breakdown

Let's go through it step-by-step 👇

## ✅ Problem Summary

> Given an array of intervals where each interval is represented as `[start, end]`, **merge all overlapping intervals**.

---

## ✅ Java Code with Telugu-style Comments

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int[][] merge(int[][] intervals) {
        if (intervals.length <= 1)
            return intervals; // ✅ 1 interval unte merge cheyyadam unnecessary

        // ✅ Step 1: Intervals ni starting point ni base chesi sort cheyyali
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (i1, i2) -> Integer.compare(i1[0], i2[0]));

        List<int[]> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int[] newInterval = intervals[0]; // ✅ First interval ni result lo add cheddam
        result.add(newInterval);

        for (int[] interval : intervals) {
            // ✅ Overlapping unte: current interval start <= previous interval end
            if (interval[0] <= newInterval[1]) {
                // ✅ Merge cheyyali: maximum end value ni update cheyyali
                newInterval[1] = Math.max(newInterval[1], interval[1]);
            } else {
                // ❌ Overlap ledu → new disjoint interval start avutundi
                newInterval = interval;
                result.add(newInterval); // Add to result
            }
        }

        // ✅ List ni array ga convert cheyyadam
        return result.toArray(new int[result.size()][]);
    }
}
```

## ✅ Test Cases (Happy Path + Edge Cases)

### 🧪 Test Case 1: Basic Overlapping Intervals

```java
Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: [1,3] and [2,6] merge to [1,6]
```

---

### 🧪 Test Case 2: Complete Overlap

```java
Input: [[1,4],[2,3]]
Output: [[1,4]]
Explanation: [2,3] is fully inside [1,4]
```

---

### 🧪 Test Case 3: Disjoint Intervals

```java
Input: [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]]
Output: [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]]
Explanation: No merging needed
```

---

### 🧪 Test Case 4: Fully Overlapping

```java
Input: [[1,10],[2,3],[4,5],[6,7]]
Output: [[1,10]]
Explanation: All smaller intervals fit within [1,10]
```

---

### 🧪 Test Case 5: Single Interval (Edge Case)

```java
Input: [[5,10]]
Output: [[5,10]]
Explanation: Only one interval
```

---

### 🧪 Test Case 6: Empty Input

```java
Input: []
Output: []
Explanation: Nothing to merge
```

---

### 🧪 Test Case 7: All Same Start Time

```java
Input: [[1,3],[1,2],[1,4]]
Output: [[1,4]]
Explanation: All start at 1, merge by max end
```

## ✅ Time & Space Complexity

| Metric   | Value        | Explanation               |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------------------- |
| ⏱ Time   | `O(n log n)` | Due to sorting step       |
| 🧠 Space | `O(n)`       | Output list in worst case |

---

## ✅ Summary

> “Intervals are first sorted by start time. Then we iterate and merge any overlapping intervals based on start ≤ previous end. If no overlap, we add a new group. This handles edge cases like single, empty, nested, or disjoint intervals cleanly.”

Would you like:

* ✅ Version that also tracks original indices of intervals?
* ✅ In-place merging version?
* ✅ Version using custom `Interval` class?
