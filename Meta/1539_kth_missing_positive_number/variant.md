# // VARIANT: What if you had to return the Kth missing positive number from the leftmost element?

Absolutely! Here's the **Variant Approach** (K-th Missing Relative to `arr[0]`) in **5–6 easy bullet points** for quick memorization:

---

### ✅ Variant: K-th Missing Number *After `arr[0]`*

* 🔢 In a perfect array starting at `arr[0]`, expected value at index `i` is `arr[0] + i`.

* 🔍 Use binary search to count **missing numbers** up to `mid`:
  👉 `missing = arr[mid] - arr[0] - mid`

* 📉 If `missing < k`, go **right**: `left = mid + 1`
  📈 Else go **left**: `right = mid - 1`

* 🎯 Final position: `right` is the last known index before we cross `k` missing numbers.

* 🧮 Final result:

  ```java
  arr[0] + k + right
  ```

  → Starting point + k missing + right valid values before it.

* ✅ Works even when `arr[0] > 1`, unlike the original version that always assumes start from 1.

## ✅ Java Code with Telugu Comments

```java
public class KthMissingRelative {

    public int findKthPositiveVariant(int[] arr, int k) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = arr.length - 1;

        // ✅ Binary search loop
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

            // ✅ arr[mid] - arr[0] → theoretical length if no missing
            // ✅ actual index = mid → missing count = arr[mid] - arr[0] - mid
            int missing = arr[mid] - arr[0] - mid;

            if (missing < k) {
                // ✅ missing thakkuva → manaki kavalsina k-th missing right side lo untundi
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                // ✅ already k lekapothe ekkuva missing → go left
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }

        // ✅ Final result = arr[0] + k + right
        // Why? arr[0] start point + k gaps + right index (past valid element)
        return arr[0] + k + right;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        KthMissingRelative solution = new KthMissingRelative();

        // 🔍 Test Cases
        System.out.println(solution.findKthPositiveVariant(new int[]{10, 12, 13, 14}, 3)); // 14
        System.out.println(solution.findKthPositiveVariant(new int[]{7, 8, 10, 13}, 4));   // 12
        System.out.println(solution.findKthPositiveVariant(new int[]{100, 102, 105}, 2));  // 103
        System.out.println(solution.findKthPositiveVariant(new int[]{5, 6, 9}, 5));        // 10
        System.out.println(solution.findKthPositiveVariant(new int[]{20, 21, 22}, 1));     // 23
        System.out.println(solution.findKthPositiveVariant(new int[]{3, 6, 7, 9}, 4));     // 8
        System.out.println(solution.findKthPositiveVariant(new int[]{50}, 10));            // 59
    }
}
```

## 🧠 Dry Run Example

### Input:

```java
arr = [10, 12, 13, 14], k = 3
```

* Missing numbers from 10 onward:
  `[11, 15, 16, 17, ...]`
* Between 10–12 → missing = 1
* Between 14–∞ → missing continues

### Binary search:

* Final `right = 1`
* Formula: `arr[0] + k + right = 10 + 3 + 1 = 14`

✅ Output = `14`

## ⏱ Time and Space Complexity

| Metric           | Value        | Description          |
| ---------------- | ------------ | -------------------- |
| Time Complexity  | **O(log N)** | Binary Search        |
| Space Complexity | **O(1)**     | No extra memory used |

---

## ✅ Summary

* This variant is used when:

  * Input sequence **starts from arbitrary number**, not 1.
  * We need to find **missing numbers relative to that starting point**.
* Key formula:

  ```java
  missing = arr[mid] - arr[0] - mid
  final answer = arr[0] + k + right
  ```

## ✅ Problem Difference

| Feature                      | Original Problem                              | Variant Problem (Relative to Leftmost)      |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Input Example                | `arr = [2,3,4,7,11], k = 5`                   | `arr = [10,12,13,14], k = 3`                |
| Starts counting missing from | `1` (absolute smallest number)                | `arr[0]` (first element in the array)       |
| Goal                         | Find **k-th smallest** number missing from 1  | Find **k-th missing** number after `arr[0]` |
| Use case                     | "Missing from beginning of positive integers" | "Missing from given start number"           |

## 🔍 Comparison of Key Formulae

| Part                     | Original               | Variant                   | Meaning                                      |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 🔢 Missing count formula | `arr[mid] - (mid + 1)` | `arr[mid] - arr[0] - mid` | Number of missing numbers before `mid`       |
| 🎯 Final result          | `left + k`             | `arr[0] + k + right`      | Formula to compute the actual missing number |

---

## 🔍 Deep Dive into Formulae

### 🔸 `arr[mid] - (mid + 1)` in Original

* In a perfect array: `arr[i] = i + 1`
* So missing numbers up to index `i` = `arr[i] - (i + 1)`

### 🔸 `arr[mid] - arr[0] - mid` in Variant

* In a perfect relative array:
  Expected at index `i`: `arr[0] + i`
* So missing numbers = `arr[mid] - (arr[0] + mid)` = `arr[mid] - arr[0] - mid`

---

## 🔚 Final Answer Logic

### ✅ Original:

```java
return left + k;
```

Why?

* You're **missing from 1** — so after skipping `left` existing numbers, you jump `k` ahead.

---

### ✅ Variant:

```java
return arr[0] + k + right;
```

Why?

* You start from `arr[0]`
* Skip `right + 1` numbers (last valid index before k-th missing found)
* Add `k` missing numbers → total offset = `k + right`

## 🧠 Memorization Tips

| Original (from 1)                          | Variant (from arr\[0])                        |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Use formula `arr[i] - (i + 1)` for missing | Use formula `arr[i] - arr[0] - i` for missing |
| Final answer is `left + k`                 | Final answer is `arr[0] + k + right`          |
| Assumes counting from number 1             | Assumes counting starts from `arr[0]`         |

---

## 🧪 Dry Run Example for Variant

```java
arr = [10, 12, 13, 14], k = 3
Expected missing: [11, 15, 16, …]
```

* Index 0 → `10 - 10 - 0 = 0` missing
* Index 1 → `12 - 10 - 1 = 1` missing → \[11]
* Index 2 → `13 - 10 - 2 = 1` missing → still \[11]
* Index 3 → `14 - 10 - 3 = 1` missing → still \[11]

Binary search finishes → `left = 4`, `right = 3`

Answer:

```
arr[0] + k + right = 10 + 3 + 3 = 16 ✅
```
