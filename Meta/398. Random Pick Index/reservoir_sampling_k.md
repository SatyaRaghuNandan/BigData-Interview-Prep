Absolutely! You're diving into an advanced yet practical **variant of Reservoir Sampling** — one that selects `k` items *uniformly at random* from a potentially huge or streaming dataset. This is crucial for **data sampling**, **log analysis**, or **streaming analytics**.

Let's build this up properly for interviews with:

* ✅ Python & Java code
* 🧠 Telugu comments
* 📊 Time/Space complexity
* 🔁 Multiple approaches to discuss in interviews

## ✅ Problem Recap (Reservoir Sampling – k-size Variant)

> Given an array or stream `nums` and integer `k`, pick **k elements uniformly at random without replacement**. Each item must have equal probability.

---

# ✅ Python Implementation (with Telugu Comments)

```python
import random
from typing import List

def reservoir_sampling_k(nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
    # 🧺 First k elements ni direct ga sample list lo pettaali
    result = nums[:k]

    # 🔁 Remaining elements ki uniform chance ichhi, replace cheyyali
    for i in range(k, len(nums)):
        n = i + 1  # Total elements processed so far
        r = random.randint(0, n - 1)  # 0 to n-1 range lo oka index

        # 🔄 Replace an existing element in sample with nums[i] only if r < k
        if r < k:
            result[r] = nums[i]

    return result
```

## 📊 Time and Space Complexity

| Operation | Complexity | Explanation                     |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| Time      | O(n)       | One pass through all elements   |
| Space     | O(k)       | Store only `k` sampled elements |

---

## ✅ Java Implementation (with Telugu Comments)

```java
import java.util.*;

public class ReservoirSampler {

    private final Random rand = new Random();

    public int[] reservoirSamplingK(int[] nums, int k) {
        int[] result = new int[k];

        // 🧺 First k elements ni result array lo copy cheyyali
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            result[i] = nums[i];
        }

        // 🔁 For remaining elements, probabilistically replace existing ones
        for (int i = k; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int n = i + 1;  // Total elements processed
            int r = rand.nextInt(n);  // Random index from 0 to n-1

            // 🔄 Replace an existing index only if r < k
            if (r < k) {
                result[r] = nums[i];
            }
        }

        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ReservoirSampler sampler = new ReservoirSampler();
        int[] nums = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70};
        int[] result = sampler.reservoirSamplingK(nums, 3);

        System.out.println("Sampled k elements:");
        for (int val : result) {
            System.out.print(val + " ");
        }
    }
}
```

## ✅ Example Output

```java
Sampled k elements:
30 60 20  ← Random output; uniform but varies run-to-run
```

## 🔁 Multiple Approaches (For Interviews)

| Approach                             | Time       | Space | Notes                                              |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Reservoir Sampling**               | O(n)       | O(k)  | Ideal for streams; uniform distribution            |
| **Shuffle + Pick k**                 | O(n)       | O(n)  | Not suitable for streams; uses extra memory        |
| **Priority Queue (Streaming Top-k)** | O(n log k) | O(k)  | Good when sampling by weighted rules (not uniform) |

### 🎤 Interview Talking Points

> “Reservoir Sampling is my go-to for uniformly sampling `k` items from a large or streaming input. It guarantees uniform probability in `O(n)` time and `O(k)` space. It's also ideal when we can't store the entire input, unlike shuffle-based approaches which need all elements in memory.”

## 📌 Use Cases

* Streaming log analysis
* Sampling from a Kafka stream
* Online polling/voting systems
* Big data (MapReduce style) distributed sampling
