Here‚Äôs a full explanation of the **MedianFinder** design with Telugu-style comments, approach, time/space complexity, and also answers your question ‚Äî *is there a better way for O(1) `findMedian()`*?

---

### ‚úÖ **Approach (in Plain English):**

1. We maintain **two heaps**:

   * A **Max Heap** (`small`) for the smaller half of numbers.
   * A **Min Heap** (`large`) for the larger half.
2. This helps us **balance** the two halves so we can fetch the median easily.
3. When adding a number:

   * If total count is even, we insert into `large`, then move the smallest from `large` to `small`.
   * If odd, we insert into `small`, then move the largest from `small` to `large`.
4. Median is either the top of `small` (odd size) or average of both tops (even size).
5. This ensures **O(log n)** for insertion and **O(1)** for median lookup.

```java
class MedianFinder {

    // Small half numbers ni store cheyyadaniki Max Heap (largest element peek lo untadi)
    private PriorityQueue<Integer> small = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());

    // Large half numbers ni store cheyyadaniki Min Heap (smallest element peek lo untadi)
    private PriorityQueue<Integer> large = new PriorityQueue<>();

    // Count even or odd ani cheyyataniki flag
    private boolean even = true;

    // Median ni direct ga calculate cheyyachu in O(1)
    public double findMedian() {
        if (even) {
            // Even count ayithe middle two numbers ni average cheyyali
            return (small.peek() + large.peek()) / 2.0;
        } else {
            // Odd count ayithe max heap top (middle element) return cheyyali
            return small.peek();
        }
    }

    public void addNum(int num) {
        if (even) {
            // Large heap lo add chesi, smallest ni small heap lo pumpinchali
            large.offer(num);
            small.offer(large.poll());
        } else {
            // Small heap lo add chesi, largest ni large heap lo pumpinchali
            small.offer(num);
            large.offer(small.poll());
        }
        // Toggle even/odd count
        even = !even;
    }
}
```

### ‚è±Ô∏è Time and Space Complexity

| Operation      | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| -------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| `addNum()`     | O(log n)        | O(n)             |
| `findMedian()` | O(1)            | O(1)             |

### ‚ùì Is there a better way?

* ‚úÖ **This is the optimal solution** for real-time streaming median problems.
* üîÅ You can‚Äôt do better than `O(log n)` insertion because **heaps require sorting** logic.
* ‚úÖ But `findMedian()` is already **O(1)** ‚Äî which is optimal.

---

### üìå Summary

* Two Heaps ‚Üí Balanced ‚Üí Easy median.
* Always maintain: `small.size() == large.size()` or `small.size() == large.size() + 1`.
* `addNum()` ‚Üí O(log n), `findMedian()` ‚Üí O(1) ‚úÖ

Let me know if you want a **version with sorted array + binary insertion (TreeSet / AVL Tree)** for comparison!



You're using a **slightly improved and more intuitive version** of the two-heap approach to maintain the running median ‚Äî compared to the `even` flag version. Let's break this down properly.

---

### ‚úÖ **Approach (Plain English ‚Äì 5 Bullet Points)**

1. **Two Heaps** are maintained:

   * `maxHeap` (left side): stores the **smaller half**, max on top.
   * `minHeap` (right side): stores the **larger half**, min on top.
2. When a new number comes in:

   * If it's smaller than or equal to the top of `maxHeap`, it belongs to the left side.
   * Otherwise, it's placed in the right side (`minHeap`).
3. After insertion, **rebalancing** ensures:

   * `maxHeap.size()` ‚â• `minHeap.size()`
   * And their size difference is at most **1**.
4. If total count is **even**, return average of tops of both heaps.
5. If **odd**, return top of the `maxHeap` (since it's guaranteed to have 1 more element).

### üí¨ Telugu Comments Version of Code

```java
class MedianFinder {

    // MaxHeap: Small half values ni store chestundi, max peek lo untundi
    private Queue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());

    // MinHeap: Large half values ni store chestundi, min peek lo untundi
    private Queue<Integer> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();

    public void addNum(int num) {
        // MaxHeap lo pettali if it's smaller or equal to current max
        if (maxHeap.isEmpty() || num <= maxHeap.peek())
            maxHeap.offer(num);
        else
            minHeap.offer(num);

        // Balancing: difference 1 kanna ekkuva kakudadhu
        if (maxHeap.size() < minHeap.size()) {
            maxHeap.offer(minHeap.poll()); // minHeap nunchi maxHeap ki shift
        } else if (maxHeap.size() - minHeap.size() > 1) {
            minHeap.offer(maxHeap.poll()); // maxHeap nunchi minHeap ki shift
        }
    }

    public double findMedian() {
        // Rendu heaps size equal ayithe average tiskovali
        if (maxHeap.size() == minHeap.size()) {
            return (double) (maxHeap.peek() + minHeap.peek()) / 2.0;
        }
        // Leda maxHeap peek median
        return (double) maxHeap.peek();
    }
}
```

### üß† Which version is better?

| Feature                         | Your New Version        | Old Version (with `even` flag)       |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |

| Rebalancing Logic               | ‚úÖ Explicit & clear      | ‚úÖ Implicit via even toggle           |
| Median Calculation              | ‚úÖ Clear with heap sizes | ‚úÖ Works but less self-explanatory    |
| Interview/Production Preference | ‚úÖ Preferred             | ‚úÖ Acceptable                         |

### ü™Ñ Summary

* **This version is cleaner and preferred in interviews**.
* Still uses **two heaps** and gives **O(1)** median lookup.
* Best approach for streaming data and dynamic medians.

Let me know if you'd like to see a **TreeMap / AVL Tree (multiset)** version (allows deletions too)!


Great questions! Let's break down both:

---

### ‚ùì **1. Why does this question need a `Queue` (specifically PriorityQueue)?**

#### ‚úÖ Reason: We need efficient access to **min** and **max** values ‚Äî and that‚Äôs exactly what a `PriorityQueue` (Heap) gives us.

* `PriorityQueue` in Java is a **Min-Heap by default**.
* `new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder())` gives you a **Max-Heap**.

We use **two heaps** (priority queues) to split the data:

* One heap gives you the **maximum of the smaller half** (`maxHeap`).
* The other gives you the **minimum of the larger half** (`minHeap`).

üëâ So, in **O(1)** time, we can access the two middle elements (max of left, min of right)
üëâ And in **O(log n)** time, we can insert a new number and still maintain the heap property.

---

### ‚ùì **2. Why does it have to be balanced?**

#### ‚úÖ Reason: To **accurately calculate the median** from a dynamic stream of numbers.

We want to find the **middle value(s)** efficiently, and that only works if the data is divided **evenly** into two halves:

#### üéØ Two Scenarios:

* If total count is **even**, median = average of middle two numbers.
* If total count is **odd**, median = middle number (which must be the top of `maxHeap`).

#### üí° Why balance matters:

If the heaps are **not balanced**, the median calculation becomes incorrect:

* `maxHeap` should always have **equal** or **one more** element than `minHeap`.
* This way:

  * You can get the **median directly from tops** of the heaps.
  * And your insertions won‚Äôt skew the halves.

---

### üìä Visualization:

Example: Stream = \[2, 5, 3, 8, 7]

| Step | MaxHeap (Left Side) | MinHeap (Right Side) | Median  |
| ---- | ------------------- | -------------------- | ------- |
| 2    | \[2]                | \[]                  | 2       |
| 5    | \[2]                | \[5]                 | (2+5)/2 |
| 3    | \[3,2]              | \[5]                 | 3       |
| 8    | \[3,2]              | \[5,8]               | (3+5)/2 |
| 7    | \[5,2,3]            | \[7,8]               | 5       |

Notice how we **rebalance** after each insertion to ensure size conditions.

### ‚úÖ TL;DR Summary

| Concept          | Why Needed                                                           |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Queue / Heap** | To get min/max values quickly (needed for median)                    |
| **Balancing**    | To ensure the two halves of the stream are equally split or off by 1 |
| **Efficiency**   | `addNum()` in O(log n), `findMedian()` in O(1)                       |
