Here's a detailed walkthrough of your `findKthSmallest` implementation with **in-code comments in English and Telugu (transliterated)** for better understanding and retention:

### âœ… Final Version with Comments

```python
from heapq import heappush, heappop


class Solution:
    def findKthSmallest(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Telugu: Max heap ni simulate cheyyadam kosam negative values vadutunnam
        # Idea: Top k smallest elements ni maintain cheyyali, anduke max heap
        max_heap = []

        for num in nums:
            # Telugu: -num ni push chesthe max heap la act chestundi
            heappush(max_heap, -num)

            # Telugu: heap size k kanna ekkuva aithe, max element ni pop cheyyadam
            if len(max_heap) > k:
                heappop(max_heap)

        # Telugu: max_heap lo top lo k-th smallest untundi (negative kabatti reverse cheyyali)
        return -max_heap[0]
```

### ðŸ“Œ Explanation

* We **simulate a max heap** using negative values since Pythonâ€™s `heapq` is a min-heap by default.
* By pushing `-num` into the heap, the **largest of the smallest `k` elements** will always be at the root.
* Once the size exceeds `k`, we pop out the largest (i.e., least useful) among them.
* Eventually, `-max_heap[0]` will give us the actual `k`-th smallest.

---

### âœ… Time & Space Complexity

* **Time Complexity**: `O(n log k)`
  Where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`, and `k` is the heap size.

* **Space Complexity**: `O(k)`
  Only `k` elements are stored in the heap at any time.

### ðŸ§ª Test Case Summary

You've already covered:

* Basic random input
* Fully sorted or reverse-sorted arrays
* Duplicate elements
* All negative numbers

Thatâ€™s a great test suite. No changes needed there.

Let me know if you'd like:

* A **Java version** with PriorityQueue,
* A **QuickSelect** alternative (O(n) average time),
* Or a variation for \*\*`k`-th **largest** using min-heap instead.
