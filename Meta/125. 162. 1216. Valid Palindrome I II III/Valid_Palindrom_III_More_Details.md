## ‚úÖ Problem Recap (Valid Palindrome III)

> Check whether a string `s` can become a **palindrome** by removing **at most `k` characters**.

---

## ‚úÖ Approach: Top-down **Recursive Memoization**

We need to:

* Count the **minimum deletions** needed to make the string a palindrome.
* If deletions ‚â§ `k` ‚Üí ‚úÖ return True

### üîÅ Core Idea:

Let `dp(i, j)` be the **minimum number of deletions** needed to make `s[i...j]` a palindrome.

* If `s[i] == s[j]`: no deletion needed ‚Üí `dp(i, j) = dp(i+1, j-1)`
* If `s[i] != s[j]`: remove one side ‚Üí
  `dp(i, j) = 1 + min(dp(i+1, j), dp(i, j-1))`

## ‚úÖ Python Code (Clean Structure + Telugu Comments)

```python
from functools import lru_cache

class Solution:
    def isValidPalindrome(self, s: str, k: int) -> bool:

        @lru_cache(None)  # Memoization to cache overlapping subproblems
        def min_deletions(left: int, right: int) -> int:
            # üõë Base Case: Empty or 1-char substring is always a palindrome
            if left >= right:
                return 0

            # ‚úÖ Characters match ‚Äî check inner substring
            if s[left] == s[right]:
                return min_deletions(left + 1, right - 1)

            # ‚ùå Characters don't match ‚Äî try deleting left or right
            delete_left = min_deletions(left + 1, right)
            delete_right = min_deletions(left, right - 1)

            return 1 + min(delete_left, delete_right)

        # Final check ‚Äî if required deletions are within allowed limit
        return min_deletions(0, len(s) - 1) <= k
```

| Metric   | Value    | Explanation                                      |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| ‚è± Time   | `O(N^2)` | Each pair `(i, j)` called once                   |

## ‚úÖ Dry Run Example

### Input:

```python
s = "abcdeca"
k = 2
```

We want to see if we can make `"abcdeca"` a palindrome by removing ‚â§ 2 characters.

---

### Step-by-Step Trace:

```text
min_deletions(0, 6) ‚Üí s[0] = 'a', s[6] = 'a' ‚úÖ match ‚Üí call min_deletions(1,5)

min_deletions(1,5) ‚Üí s[1] = 'b', s[5] = 'c' ‚ùå mismatch ‚Üí try:
    - delete 'b' ‚Üí min_deletions(2,5)
    - delete 'c' ‚Üí min_deletions(1,4)

min_deletions(2,5) ‚Üí s[2]='c', s[5]='c' ‚úÖ ‚Üí min_deletions(3,4)
min_deletions(3,4) ‚Üí s[3]='d', s[4]='e' ‚ùå ‚Üí try:
    - delete 'd' ‚Üí min_deletions(4,4) = 0
    - delete 'e' ‚Üí min_deletions(3,3) = 0
‚Üí min_deletions(3,4) = 1

So, min_deletions(2,5) = 1
min_deletions(1,4) = 2 (via similar logic)

‚Üí min_deletions(1,5) = 1 + min(1,2) = 2

‚Üí min_deletions(0,6) = 2 ‚úÖ ‚Üí 2 ‚â§ k = 2 ‚Üí ‚úÖ return True
```

## ‚úÖ Output:

```python
True
```

## ‚úÖ Summary for Interviews (How to Explain)

> ‚ÄúThis problem is a classic variation of checking whether we can turn a string into a palindrome using at most `k` deletions. I used top-down recursion with memoization (`dp(i, j)` for the substring `s[i...j]`) to compute the minimum number of deletions needed. At each mismatch, I try both options ‚Äî deleting left or right ‚Äî and take the better path. We finally check whether the result is within the allowed limit.‚Äù

Let me know if you'd like:

* The bottom-up DP version for comparison
* Java version with comments
* Or more dry runs on edge cases like palindromes or long strings with tight `k` values.
