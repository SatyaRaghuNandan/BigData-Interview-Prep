Here is your Python solution for **Leetcode 1004 â€“ Max Consecutive Ones III**, rewritten with detailed **Telugu comments** and clear **time and space complexity analysis**.

### âœ… Python Code with Telugu Comments

```python
from typing import List

def longestOnes_1004_python(nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
    max_length = 0  # Ila max consecutive ones length ni track cheyadam
    left = 0  # Sliding window left pointer

    for right in range(len(nums)):
        # nums[right] == 0 ante flip cheyyali, so k ni reduce cheyyali
        if nums[right] == 0:
            k -= 1

        # k < 0 ante, ekkuva 0s ni flip chesam, so left ni move cheyali
        while k < 0:
            # left daggara 0 vunte, adi remove avutundi kabatti k ni increment cheyyali
            if nums[left] == 0:
                k += 1
            # left window ni forward cheyyadam
            left += 1

        # max_length ni update cheyyadam, current window size = right - left + 1
        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)

    return max_length
```

### ðŸ§  Explanation in Simple Terms:

We are allowed to **flip at most `k` zeros to ones**. So:

* Use a **sliding window** to include as many `1`s and **at most `k` flipped `0`s**.
* When the number of zeros flipped **exceeds `k`**, move the `left` pointer forward to **restore validity**.

---

### ðŸ•’ Time Complexity: `O(n)`

* `right` pointer goes from `0` to `n - 1` â†’ **`O(n)`**
* `left` pointer also moves **at most `n` times**
* âœ… Total Time: **O(n)**

---

### ðŸ§® Space Complexity: `O(1)`

* We are using just a few integer variables (`left`, `right`, `max_length`, `k`)
* No extra space based on input size
* âœ… Total Space: **O(1)**

---

### ðŸ“Œ Example Dry Run:

```python
nums = [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
k = 2
```

* Max 2 zeros can be flipped.
* Answer: 6 (from index 0 to 5 â†’ \[1,1,0,0,1,1])
