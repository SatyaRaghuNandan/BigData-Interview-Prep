Here’s a 5-sentence description of the sliding window approach used in the Java solution:

1. We maintain a window `[left, right]` and try to include as many `1`s as possible, allowing up to `k` zeros to be flipped.
2. As we iterate with the `right` pointer, we decrement `k` whenever we see a zero, since we are "flipping" it to one.
3. If `k` becomes negative, it means we've flipped more than allowed, so we move the `left` pointer forward to shrink the window and restore validity.
4. While moving `left`, if the element leaving the window is a zero, we increment `k` since we're undoing a flip.
5. At every step, we update the maximum window size using `right - left + 1` to track the longest valid subarray.





Here's the equivalent **efficient Java implementation** for Leetcode 1004: *Max Consecutive Ones III* using the **sliding window** approach (same logic as your Python code), with **detailed Telugu comments**:

### ✅ Java Code – Sliding Window (O(N) Time, O(1) Space)

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestOnes(int[] nums, int k) {
        int maxLength = 0; // Ila maximum window length ni store cheyyali
        int left = 0; // Sliding window left pointer

        for (int right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
            // nums[right] == 0 ante flip cheyyali kabatti k ni reduce cheyyali
            if (nums[right] == 0) {
                k--;
            }

            // k < 0 ante, already ekkuva 0s flip chesam, so window shrink cheyyali
            while (k < 0) {
                // nums[left] == 0 ante, adi window nunchi bayataki velthundi so k ni increment cheyyali
                if (nums[left] == 0) {
                    k++;
                }
                // left pointer ni move cheyyali to shrink window
                left++;
            }

            // max window length ni update cheyyali
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
        }

        return maxLength;
    }
}
```

### ✅ Time & Space Complexity

* **Time Complexity**: `O(N)` – Each element is visited at most twice (right and left pointers).
* **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` – No extra data structures used.

* Here are **two alternative approaches** for solving **Leetcode 1004 (Max Consecutive Ones III)** and why the **sliding window** approach is preferred:

---

### ✅ **Approach 1: Brute Force**

* **Idea**: For every subarray, count how many zeros are present. If the number of zeros is ≤ `k`, calculate its length and update the max.
* **Time Complexity**: `O(N^2)` – You check all possible subarrays.
* **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`
* **Why Not Preferred**: Very slow for large arrays. Not scalable.

---

### ✅ **Approach 2: Prefix Sum + Binary Search**

* **Idea**:

  * Build a prefix sum array that counts the number of zeros up to each index.
  * For each `right` index, use binary search to find the leftmost index where the number of zeros in the window is at most `k`.
* **Time Complexity**: `O(N log N)` – One binary search for each index.
* **Space Complexity**: `O(N)` – To store prefix sums.
* **Why Not Preferred**: Slightly better than brute force, but still slower and more complex than sliding window.

---

### ✅ Why Sliding Window is Better

* It runs in **linear time `O(N)`**, uses **constant space**, and is **simple, intuitive**, and **easy to implement**.
* It dynamically adjusts the window and avoids unnecessary re-computation, making it optimal for this type of problem.

Let me know if you want code for any of the two approaches.

Let me know if you want to **track which indices were flipped** or **return the subarray itself** – I can extend this solution.
