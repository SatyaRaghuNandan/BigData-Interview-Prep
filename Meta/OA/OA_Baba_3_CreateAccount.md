Great question! Let's go deep into **realistic test cases for the `createAccount` method**, as you'd see in a **CodeSignal-style Meta Online Coding Assessment (OCA)**.

This is especially important because even simple methods like `createAccount` are tested rigorously — not just for correctness, but also for:
- Handling edge inputs
- Ensuring uniqueness of account IDs
- Proper owner-account mapping
- Correct return values

## 🧪 `createAccount(ownerId)` – Specification Recap

### Method Signature:
```java
public String createAccount(String ownerId)
```

### Requirements:
- Generate and return a unique `accountId` string.
- Associate it with the given `ownerId`.
- Account starts with $0 balance.
- Return value must be non-null and follow format `"acc1"`, `"acc2"`, etc.

---

## ✅ Valid Test Cases

| Input (`ownerId`) | Expected Output | Notes |
|------------------|------------------|-------|
| `"u1"`           | `"acc1"`         | First account ever |
| `"u2"`           | `"acc2"`         | Second user gets next ID |
| `"u1"`           | `"acc3"`         | Same user can have multiple accounts |
| `"admin"`        | `"acc4"`         | Any string is valid ownerId |

**Expected Side Effects:**
- Account should appear in `ownerToAccounts`
- Balance should be initialized to 0.0
- Should be usable in future operations like deposit, transfer, etc.

## ❌ Invalid / Edge Case Test Cases

| Input (`ownerId`) | Expected Output | Notes |
|------------------|------------------|-------|
| `null`           | Exception? Or return `null`? | Depends on spec – usually **not enforced**, so allowed |
| `""`             | `"acc5"`         | Empty string is still a valid ownerId |
| `"   "`          | `"acc6"`         | Whitespace-only ownerId – still valid |
| Multiple calls for same owner | `"acc7"`, `"acc8"` | Each call creates new account |

> ⚠️ **Note:** In CodeSignal-style problems, you're usually **not required to validate inputs** unless explicitly stated. So assume all input strings are valid unless told otherwise.

---

## 🧪 Sample Output Format (What You Must Return)

| Call # | Owner ID | Returned Account ID |
|--------|----------|----------------------|
| 1      | `"u1"`   | `"acc1"`             |
| 2      | `"u2"`   | `"acc2"`             |
| 3      | `"u1"`   | `"acc3"`             |
| 4      | `"u3"`   | `"acc4"`             |

## 🔍 What Happens Internally?

After calling:

```java
String acc1 = bank.createAccount("u1");
```

The system should now have:

```java
balances.get("acc1") == 0.0
ownerToAccounts.get("u1").contains("acc1") == true
```

## 📋 Realistic CodeSignal-Style Test Case Descriptions (Text)

Here’s how the **test cases might look in an actual CodeSignal problem description**:

---

### ✅ Test Case 1: Basic Account Creation

**Input:**
```java
bank.createAccount("user123")
```

**Expected Output:**
```
"acc1"
```

**Explanation:**
First account created, assigned to `"user123"`, ID follows naming convention.

---

### ✅ Test Case 2: Multiple Accounts for Same User

**Input:**
```java
bank.createAccount("user123");
bank.createAccount("user123");
```

**Expected Outputs:**
```
"acc1", "acc2"
```

**Explanation:**
Same user can own multiple accounts; each gets a new unique ID.

---

### ✅ Test Case 3: Multiple Users

**Input:**
```java
bank.createAccount("alice");
bank.createAccount("bob");
bank.createAccount("alice");
```

**Expected Outputs:**
```
"acc1", "acc2", "acc3"
```

**Explanation:**
Each user gets accounts in order of creation, no interference between users.

---

### ✅ Test Case 4: Empty Owner ID

**Input:**
```java
bank.createAccount("");
```

**Expected Output:**
```
"acc1"
```

**Explanation:**
Empty string is still a valid ownerId; system doesn’t enforce any format.

---

### ✅ Test Case 5: Null Owner ID

**Input:**
```java
bank.createAccount(null);
```

**Expected Output:**
```
"acc1"
```

**Explanation:**
Unless specified, null ownerId is acceptable and stored as such.

---

### ✅ Test Case 6: Verify Internal State After Creation

**Input:**
```java
String acc = bank.createAccount("john_doe");
Double balance = bank.getBalance(acc);
```

**Expected Output:**
```
balance == 0.0
```

**Explanation:**
Newly created account has zero balance.
