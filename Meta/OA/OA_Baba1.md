Absolutely! Let's **expand on Level 2: Metadata**, specifically in the context of a **banking system** like the one you described — which includes:

- Accounts
- Transfers
- Cashback
- Identification of top customers
- Merging customers

---

## 🧠 What is "Metadata" in This Context?

In the **CodeSignal-style Meta OCA**, **metadata** usually refers to **auxiliary data** that enriches your core objects (like accounts or transactions), and may be needed for more complex logic in later levels.

It’s not just about storing extra info — it's about **tracking relationships, history, or statistics** that become critical when building advanced features like:
- Cashback rules
- Customer ranking
- Account merging
- Transaction history

## 💡 Example Metadata You Might Track in a Banking System

| Metadata Type | Description | Use Case / Purpose |
|---------------|-------------|--------------------|
| ✅ **Transaction History** | List of all deposits, withdrawals, transfers per account | Needed for audit logs, cashback calculation, customer insights |
| ✅ **Cashback Tracking** | Total purchases by time period or category | Apply different cashback % based on categories or time frames |
| ✅ **Customer Profile Data** | Name, email, join date, etc. | For identifying users beyond just ownerId |
| ✅ **Account Tags / Types** | E.g., savings, checking, premium | Differentiate behavior or apply rules |
| ✅ **Transfer Relationships** | Who has sent money to whom | Detect frequent interactions, suggest merged accounts |
| ✅ **Daily/Monthly Stats** | Daily transaction volume, balance changes | Enforce rate limits, calculate interest, generate reports |
| ✅ **Referral/Partner IDs** | Where did this user come from? | Marketing analytics, loyalty programs |

## 🔁 How Metadata Can Be Used Across Levels

Let’s walk through how metadata can be introduced in **Level 2**, then used in **Levels 3 & 4**.

---

### 🧱 **Level 1 Recap (CRUD)**

You already have:
- Create Account
- Deposit / Withdraw
- Get Balance
- Transfer Between Accounts

```java
Map<String, Double> balances = new HashMap<>();
```

---

### 📦 **Level 2: Add Metadata**

Let’s add metadata to support future complexity:

#### 1. **Transaction History**
Track each deposit, withdrawal, and transfer.

```java
Map<String, List<Transaction>> transactionHistory = new HashMap<>();

static class Transaction {
    String accountId;
    String type; // "deposit", "withdrawal", "transfer_out", "transfer_in"
    double amount;
    long timestamp;

    Transaction(String accountId, String type, double amount, long timestamp) {
        this.accountId = accountId;
        this.type = type;
        this.amount = amount;
        this.timestamp = timestamp;
    }
}
```

Update deposit to record a transaction:

```java
public boolean deposit(String accountId, double amount) {
    if (amount <= 0 || !balances.containsKey(accountId)) return false;
    balances.put(accountId, balances.get(accountId) + amount);
    
    transactionHistory.computeIfAbsent(accountId, k -> new ArrayList<>())
                      .add(new Transaction(accountId, "deposit", amount, System.currentTimeMillis()));
    
    return true;
}
```

Same for `withdraw`, `transfer`, etc.

---

#### 2. **Cashback Categories**
Let’s say now we want to give **different cashback rates** based on purchase categories.

```java
Map<String, Map<String, Double>> categorySpending = new HashMap<>(); 
// accountId → (category → total spent)
```

Now, instead of just `recordPurchase(accountId, amount)`, you might get:

```java
public boolean recordPurchase(String accountId, String category, double amount) { ... }
```

Then use this to compute cashback with category-specific rules:

```java
public boolean applyCashback(String accountId) {
    Map<String, Double> spending = categorySpending.getOrDefault(accountId, Collections.emptyMap());
    double totalCashback = 0.0;

    for (Map.Entry<String, Double> entry : spending.entrySet()) {
        String category = entry.getKey();
        double amount = entry.getValue();

        double rate = switch (category) {
            case "grocery" -> 0.02;
            case "travel" -> 0.015;
            default -> 0.01;
        };

        totalCashback += amount * rate;
    }

    if (totalCashback > 0) {
        balances.put(accountId, balances.get(accountId) + totalCashback);
        categorySpending.remove(accountId); // Reset after applying
        return true;
    }

    return false;
}
```

---

#### 3. **Customer Profiles**
Instead of just ownerId, track real user details:

```java
Map<String, Customer> customerProfiles = new HashMap<>();

static class Customer {
    String id;
    String name;
    String email;
    String joinedAt;

    Customer(String id, String name, String email, String joinedAt) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.email = email;
        this.joinedAt = joinedAt;
    }
}
```

Used later for:
- Merging users
- Ranking top customers
- Personalized offers

---

### 🔗 **Level 3: Use Metadata to Build Relationships**

Now that you have metadata like:
- Transaction history
- Spending categories
- User profiles

You can build higher-level logic like:

#### 🔄 Merge Similar Customers

Using transaction patterns, find customers who might be the same person.

```java
public String mergeSimilarCustomers() {
    // Find customers who transferred between accounts frequently
    // or had similar spending patterns
    // Then merge them into one profile
}
```

This requires analyzing metadata across multiple accounts.

---

### 📊 **Level 4: Batch Operations Using Metadata**

Examples:

#### 🥇 Top N Customers by Monthly Spending

Use metadata like:
- Date-stamped transactions
- Category-based spending

```java
public List<String> getTopMonthlySpenders(int n, String month) {
    // Filter transactions in the given month
    // Sum up spending per user
    // Return top N users
}
```

#### 🧮 Batch Apply Cashback

Apply cashback to all active accounts:

```java
public int batchApplyCashback() {
    int count = 0;
    for (String accountId : balances.keySet()) {
        if (applyCashback(accountId)) count++;
    }
    return count;
}
```

## 📌 Summary Table

| Level | Feature | Metadata Involved |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| 1     | CRUD operations | None yet |
| 2     | Metadata | Transaction history, spending categories, user profiles |
| 3     | Relationships | Merging accounts, detecting duplicate users |
| 4     | Batch/Scaled Ops | Aggregating monthly stats, bulk cashback |
