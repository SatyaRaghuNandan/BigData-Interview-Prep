Absolutely! Here's a **summary of the components and features** implemented in the Meta-style Java project for the **Banking System Simulation**:

---

## âœ… 1. **Model Creation (Core Entities)**

### ðŸ”¹ `Account` class

* Fields: `accountId`, `balance`, `List<String> transactionLog`
* Responsibilities:

  * Handle `deposit()`, `withdraw()`
  * Maintain transaction log
  * Append transfer-related logs

### ðŸ”¹ `Customer` class

* Fields: `customerId`, `Set<String> accountIds`
* Responsibilities:

  * Manage multiple linked accounts
  * Used for customer-level operations like total balance, merging, etc.

---

## âœ… 2. **Basic Functionality (Level 1)**

### Core Methods in `BankSystem`

* `createAccount(accountId, initialBalance)`
* `deposit(accountId, amount)`
* `withdraw(accountId, amount)`
* `getBalance(accountId)`

### Notes:

* Prevents duplicate account creation.
* Withdrawal fails silently if balance is insufficient.

---

## âœ… 3. **Transfers & Transaction Logs (Level 2)**

### Implemented Features:

* `transfer(fromAccount, toAccount, amount)`

  * Withdraws from one, deposits into the other (only if sufficient funds).
* `getTransactionLog(accountId)`

  * Logs for:

    * Deposits
    * Withdrawals
    * Sent transfers
    * Received transfers

---

## âœ… 4. **Customer Management, Cashback, Top-K Query (Level 3)**

### Features:

* `createCustomer(customerId)`
* `assignAccount(customerId, accountId)`
* `getCustomerBalance(customerId)`

  * Returns total balance of all accounts linked to a customer.

### Top-K Logic:

* `getTopCustomers(k)`

  * Uses a custom max-heap to return top-K customers based on total balance.
  * Tie-breaks by lexicographic customerId.

### Note:

* Placeholder in deposit for cashback logic (e.g., 2% cashback if deposit > 1000).

---

## âœ… 5. **Account Merging & Global Stats (Level 4)**

### Implemented:

* `mergeCustomers(customer1, customer2)`

  * Moves all accounts from customer2 into customer1.
  * Deletes customer2.

* `getRichestAccount()`

  * Finds account with the highest balance. Tie-breaks lexicographically.

* `getTotalCashInBank()`

  * Sums balances of all accounts in the bank.

### ðŸ§  Summary of Major Functional Areas:

| Feature Area          | Methods / Description                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| âœ… Account Operations  | `createAccount`, `deposit`, `withdraw`, `getBalance`          |
| âœ… Transfers & Logs    | `transfer`, `getTransactionLog`                               |
| âœ… Customers           | `createCustomer`, `assignAccount`, `getCustomerBalance`       |
| âœ… Analytics           | `getTopCustomers`, `getRichestAccount`, `getTotalCashInBank`  |
| âœ… Account Merging     | `mergeCustomers` â€“ customer relationship merge                |
| ðŸ”œ Cashback Extension | Placeholder for cashback in `deposit` based on business rules |
