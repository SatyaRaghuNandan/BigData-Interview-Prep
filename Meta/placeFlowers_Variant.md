This is a **variant of the original LeetCode 605** problem where, instead of returning `True/False` if `n` flowers can be placed, you're returning **how many** flowers *can* be placed in the given flowerbed.

Below is your Python code with **detailed comments in Telugu (written in English script)** and a breakdown of the logic:

### âœ… **Code with Telugu Comments**

```python
from typing import List

# VARIANT: Ee problem lo total enni flowers ni place cheyyavacho return cheyyali
class Solution:
    def placeFlowers(self, flowerbed: List[int]) -> int:
        i = 0
        placed = 0  # total flowers placed counter

        while i < len(flowerbed):
            # i == 0 ante first position, so left plot ledu, assume 0
            empty_left_plot = 0 if i == 0 else flowerbed[i - 1]

            # i == last index aithe right plot ledu, assume 0
            empty_right_plot = 0 if i == len(flowerbed) - 1 else flowerbed[i + 1]

            # left, right, current anni 0 aithe flower place cheyyachu
            if flowerbed[i] == empty_left_plot == empty_right_plot == 0:
                placed += 1         # oka flower plant chesam
                i += 2              # next plot skip cheyyali (adjacent rule kosam)
            elif flowerbed[i]:      # already flower vunte, adi + next skip cheyyali
                i += 2
            else:
                i += 3              # madhyalo kuda place cheyyaleni case aithe 3 jump

        return placed
```

### ðŸ§ª **Example:**

```python
sol = Solution()
print(sol.placeFlowers([1, 0, 0, 0, 1]))   # Output: 1
print(sol.placeFlowers([0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))   # Output: 2
print(sol.placeFlowers([1, 0, 1, 0, 1]))   # Output: 0
print(sol.placeFlowers([0, 0, 1, 0, 0]))   # Output: 1
```

### ðŸ“ˆ **Time and Space Complexity**

| Metric           | Value |
| ---------------- | ----- |
| Time Complexity  | O(n)  |
| Space Complexity | O(1)  |

> Youâ€™re scanning the flowerbed once, no extra data structures used.

---

### âœ… **Summary of Logic:**

* `0` means empty.
* A flower can be planted at index `i` **only if** `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` are all `0`.
* After planting a flower, **jump 2 positions forward** to maintain non-adjacency.
* If current is `1`, skip it and the next position.
* If neither condition works, move `i += 3` to fast-forward past a blocked region.

Let me know if you want this rewritten in Java or want to add a second variant that also **returns the positions** where flowers can be planted.
