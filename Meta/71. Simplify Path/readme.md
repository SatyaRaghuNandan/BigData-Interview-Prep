Of course! Here's the same approach formatted into **5 short, memorable lines** — perfect for review or interviews:

### ✅ **5-Line Summary of `cd` Simulation**

1. **If `cd` is empty**, return `cwd` (nothing changes).
2. **Use a stack** to store current path parts (from `cwd` if `cd` is relative).
3. **Split `cd` by `/`** and process each part: skip `"."`, pop on `".."`, push folder names.
4. **Reverse the stack** to get the correct order.
5. **Join with `/`**, prefix with `/`, and return the final path.

Let me know if you want the same 5-liner as a **comment block** for your code.
