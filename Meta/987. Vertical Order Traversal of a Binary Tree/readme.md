You're working with the **Leetcode 987 - Vertical Order Traversal of a Binary Tree** problem.
This solution is correct, but let's explain it fully and convert it into a structured **interview-friendly** response with:

---

## ‚úÖ Problem Summary

> Given the `root` of a binary tree, return its **vertical order traversal**.
> In vertical order:

* Nodes are grouped by their **column**
* Within each column:

  * **Top to bottom** (smallest row first)
  * If multiple nodes have the same `(row, col)`, order them by **value**

---

## ‚úÖ Expected Output

A **List of Lists**, where each inner list contains nodes from one vertical column (from left to right).

---

## ‚úÖ Conceptual Explanation

### ‚õ≥ Coordinate System

Each node has:

* **Row** = depth in tree (starting at 0)
* **Column** = horizontal offset:

  * root ‚Üí `(0, 0)`
  * left child ‚Üí `(row+1, col-1)`
  * right child ‚Üí `(row+1, col+1)`

---

## ‚úÖ Multiple Approaches

### üîπ BFS + HashMap + Sorting (Used here) ‚úÖ

1. Do level order traversal (`BFS`) while tracking `(row, col)` for each node
2. Use a `map<col, list<(node, row)>>` to collect nodes in each column
3. For each column:

   * Sort by row, then value
   * Build the final result

üß† Easy to reason about.
‚è± Time: `O(N log N)`
‚úÖ This is the best approach for **vertical order with full tie-breaking** (row + value)

---

### üî∏ DFS + HashMap + Sorting

* You can do a recursive DFS while tracking `(row, col)`
* Same logic applies but order must be carefully handled

Less intuitive than BFS for this problem.

## ‚úÖ Detailed Python Equivalent with Telugu Comments

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def verticalTraversal(self, root: TreeNode):
        column_map = defaultdict(list)
        min_col = max_col = 0

        # ‚úÖ Step 1: BFS traversal with (row, col, node)
        queue = deque()
        queue.append((root, 0, 0))  # node, row, col

        while queue:
            node, row, col = queue.popleft()
            column_map[col].append((row, node.val))

            min_col = min(min_col, col)
            max_col = max(max_col, col)

            if node.left:
                queue.append((node.left, row + 1, col - 1))
            if node.right:
                queue.append((node.right, row + 1, col + 1))

        # ‚úÖ Step 2: Build result by sorting each column
        result = []
        for col in range(min_col, max_col + 1):
            # üîΩ Sort by (row, value) as per spec
            column = sorted(column_map[col], key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
            result.append([val for row, val in column])
        
        return result
```

## ‚úÖ Time & Space Complexity

| Metric              | Value        | Why?                             |
| ------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| üïí Time Complexity  | `O(N log N)` | Sorting nodes within each column |
| üß† Space Complexity | `O(N)`       | Map, queue, and output list      |

> Sorting happens per column, but total number of nodes is `N`, so overall sorting is bounded by `O(N log N)`

## ‚úÖ Dry Run Example

Input Tree:

```
       3
      / \
     9   20
         / \
        15  7
```

### Column Coordinates:

```
      col
        0
       / \
    -1    1
            \
             2
```

BFS assigns:

* (3, row=0, col=0)
* (9, row=1, col=-1)
* (20, row=1, col=1)
* (15, row=2, col=0)
* (7, row=2, col=2)

Group:

```
col -1: [(1, 9)]
col  0: [(0, 3), (2, 15)]
col  1: [(1, 20)]
col  2: [(2, 7)]
```

After sorting ‚Üí result:

```python
[[9], [3, 15], [20], [7]]
```

## ‚úÖ Interview-Ready Summary

> ‚ÄúI treat the tree like a 2D grid where each node has `(row, col)` coordinates. I do a level-order traversal to record all `(node.val, row)` values into a `map[col]`. After the traversal, I sort each column list by `(row, value)` to ensure vertical and lexicographical order. This gives a clean and efficient `O(N log N)` solution.‚Äù
