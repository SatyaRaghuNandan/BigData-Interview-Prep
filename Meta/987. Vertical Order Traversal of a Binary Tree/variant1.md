You're analyzing a variant of **Leetcode 987 â€“ Vertical Order Traversal of a Binary Tree**, and youâ€™re absolutely right to treat this as a **variant**. Let's break it down thoroughly:

---

## âœ… 1. How is This Variant Different from the Original?

| Feature              | ðŸ”· Original Problem (LC 987)                       | âœ… Variant (Your Code)                        |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Goal**             | Return `vector<vector<int>>` of vertical traversal | **Print** nodes column by column             |
| **Output format**    | Structured nested vector                           | Human-readable output using `std::cout`      |
| **Use case**         | Functional return for code/integration             | Debugging, diagnostics, visual verification  |
| **Data flow**        | Results used by other functions                    | Output consumed directly by humans (console) |
| **Testing approach** | Validate returned result                           | Validate printed sequence manually           |

So, the core **traversal logic and sorting are identical**, but the **output behavior is the key difference**.

## âœ… 2. Problem Recap (Vertical Order Traversal)

Given a binary tree, group nodes by **vertical columns** (left to right).
If multiple nodes fall in the same position:

* Sort by **row** first (top-down),
* Then by **node value** if rows are equal.

---

## âœ… 3. Multiple Approaches

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Approach 1: BFS + Column Map + Sorting (Recommended) âœ…**

1. Do **BFS** while tracking `(row, col)` of each node.
2. Store `(node, row)` in a map: `col â†’ list<(node, row)>`
3. Sort each columnâ€™s list by `(row, val)`
4. **Print** each sorted column.

This is your current solution and it's excellent for both correctness and performance.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Approach 2: DFS (Recursive) with Preorder Coordinates

* Traverse recursively, maintaining `(row, col)`
* Store triples `(val, row, col)` in a list
* Sort list by `(col, row, val)`
* Group by column
* **Print** by grouped column

ðŸŸ¡ This works, but:

* Harder to maintain insertion order
* Requires a **manual grouping phase**

---

### ðŸ”¹ Approach 3: Use Multimap / TreeMap Structures

* Use ordered maps (like `std::map` or `std::multimap`)
* Automatically keeps columns sorted
* But requires careful tie-breaking logic

ðŸŸ¡ Useful in languages like Java but overkill here.

---

## âœ… 4. Best Approach: BFS with Column Tracking

### Why?

* Naturally traverses in level-order (which respects row order)
* Easily tracks `(row, col)`
* Works well for sorting and vertical grouping

---

## âœ… 5. Time & Space Complexity

Let `N = total number of nodes`

| Operation                        | Time         | Space                    |
| -------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| BFS Traversal                    | `O(N)`       | `O(N)` for queue and map |
| Column Grouping (unordered\_map) | `O(N)`       | `O(N)`                   |
| Sorting each column              | `O(N log N)` | `O(N)`                   |
| Final printing                   | `O(N)`       | `O(1)`                   |
| **Total**                        | `O(N log N)` | `O(N)`                   |

Sorting dominates the time complexity because nodes can end up in same column/row, needing tie-breaks.

## âœ… 6. Sample Output Explanation

For the given tree:

```
        6
      /   \
     8     7
    / \   / \
   3  15 10  9
     /
    1
```

### (row, col) coordinates per node:

* 6 â†’ (0, 0)
* 8 â†’ (1, -1)
* 7 â†’ (1, 1)
* 3 â†’ (2, -2)
* 15 â†’ (2, 0)
* 10 â†’ (2, 0)
* 9 â†’ (2, 2)
* 1 â†’ (3, -1)

### Grouped & Sorted:

| Column | Nodes Printed |
| ------ | ------------- |
| -2     | 3             |
| -1     | 8 1           |
| 0      | 6 10 15       |
| 1      | 7             |
| 2      | 9             |

## âœ… 7. Interview-Worthy Summary

> "This variant of Leetcode 987 prints the vertical order traversal instead of returning it. I use a level-order BFS with metadata `(row, col)` to group nodes by column. After traversal, each column group is sorted by row and value, then printed in order. This is ideal for visual representation and debugging. The time complexity is `O(N log N)` due to per-column sorting."

## âœ… Would You Like:

* Python version that prints the result?
* A diagram to visualize (row, col) layout?
* Extended variant to also print row/col coordinates?
