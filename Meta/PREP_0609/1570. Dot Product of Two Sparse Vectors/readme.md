Here's a **detailed explanation** of all three approaches to implement **dot product for sparse vectors**, including pros/cons, time/space complexity, and when to use each — especially useful in interview scenarios like Meta.

---

## ✅ Problem Summary

> A sparse vector is mostly filled with zeros. We want to store it efficiently and compute the **dot product** with another sparse vector:
>
> Dot product = Σ (A\[i] × B\[i]) where i from 0 to n−1.

## 🧠 Approach 1: Full Array (Non-Efficient)

```python
class SparseVector:
    def __init__(self, nums):
        self.array = nums

    def dotProduct(self, vec):
        result = 0
        for num1, num2 in zip(self.array, vec.array):
            result += num1 * num2
        return result
```

### 🧾 Explanation:

* Stores the entire array, including zeroes.
* Iterates through all elements and multiplies corresponding indices.

### ⏱️ Time Complexity:

* **O(n)** — Iterates over all `n` elements.

### 💾 Space Complexity:

* **O(n)** — Stores the entire input vector.

### ✅ Pros:

* Simple and intuitive.

### ❌ Cons:

* Inefficient for very sparse vectors.
* Wastes space and compute on zeros.

### 📌 Use Case:

* Small dense vectors. **Avoid in interviews** for sparse data.

## 🧠 Approach 2: Hash Table (Dict of Index to Value)

```python
class SparseVector:
    def __init__(self, nums: List[int]):
        self.nonzeros = {}
        for i, n in enumerate(nums):
            if n != 0:
                self.nonzeros[i] = n              

    def dotProduct(self, vec: 'SparseVector') -> int:
        result = 0
        for i, n in self.nonzeros.items():
            if i in vec.nonzeros:
                result += n * vec.nonzeros[i]
        return result
```

### 🧾 Explanation:

* Store only **non-zero (index, value)** pairs in a dictionary.
* Iterate over one dict, and lookup in the other.

### ⏱️ Time Complexity:

* **O(k)** — where `k` is number of non-zero elements in `self`.
* Lookup is **O(1)** in average case due to hash table.

### 💾 Space Complexity:

* **O(k)** — Only stores non-zero entries.

### ✅ Pros:

* Clean and **efficient** for large sparse vectors.
* Ideal when vectors have **non-overlapping sparsity**.

### ❌ Cons:

* Slight hash overhead.

### 📌 Use Case:

* ✅ **Great for Meta/Facebook interviews**.
* Efficient and easy to justify tradeoffs.

## 🧠 Approach 3: Two-Pointer with Index-Value Pairs

```python
class SparseVector:
    def __init__(self, nums: List[int]):
        self.pairs = []
        for index, value in enumerate(nums):
            if value != 0:
                self.pairs.append([index, value])

    def dotProduct(self, vec: 'SparseVector') -> int:
        result = 0
        p, q = 0, 0

        while p < len(self.pairs) and q < len(vec.pairs):
            if self.pairs[p][0] == vec.pairs[q][0]:
                result += self.pairs[p][1] * vec.pairs[q][1]
                p += 1
                q += 1
            elif self.pairs[p][0] < vec.pairs[q][0]:
                p += 1
            else:
                q += 1
        return result
```

### 🧾 Explanation:

* Store non-zero entries as sorted (index, value) pairs.
* Use **two pointers** to walk both lists simultaneously.

### ⏱️ Time Complexity:

* **O(k + l)** — where `k` and `l` are non-zero lengths of the two vectors.

### 💾 Space Complexity:

* **O(k)** for storage

### ✅ Pros:

* Very efficient if both vectors are sparse.
* No hash lookup, just sorted merge-like traversal.

### ❌ Cons:

* Requires sorted lists.
* Slightly more code.

### 📌 Use Case:

* ✅ Best for **both vectors being sparse and sorted**.
* Impressive for **optimized interviews** with follow-ups.

## 🔚 Summary Comparison Table

| Approach    | Time     | Space | Interview Value | Notes                             |
| ----------- | -------- | ----- | --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Full Array  | O(n)     | O(n)  | ❌ Too basic     | Avoid for sparse inputs           |
| Hash Table  | O(k)     | O(k)  | ✅ Great         | Fast lookup, easy code            |
| Two-Pointer | O(k + l) | O(k)  | ✅ Advanced      | More optimal when both are sparse |

---

## 📌 Final Meta Interview Recommendation

✅ **Use Approach 2 (Hash Map)** for clarity and performance.
✅ Mention **Approach 3 (Two-Pointer)** for optimization if both vectors are sparse.
❌ Avoid Approach 1 unless explicitly asked to explain brute-force.
