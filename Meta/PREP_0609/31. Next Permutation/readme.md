To **easily remember the `nextPermutation()` algorithm**, especially in interviews, associate each step with a **visual and logical metaphor**. Here’s a structured memory guide that breaks the process into an intuitive 3-step pattern, along with a mnemonic and visual reasoning:

---

## 🧠 High-Level Intuition

You're trying to **find the next lexicographical permutation** (i.e., the "next bigger number"). If the current arrangement is the **last permutation**, return the **first permutation** (sorted in ascending order).

## ✅ Memory Framework: “**V-S-R**”

(Like: **Valley, Swap, Reverse**)

| Step | Name        | What to Do                                             | Why?                                             |
| ---- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 1️⃣  | **V**alley  | Find the first index going *down* from the end         | This is the "pivot" where the next change starts |
| 2️⃣  | **S**wap    | Find the smallest number > pivot on the right and swap | To make it just bigger                           |
| 3️⃣  | **R**everse | Reverse the suffix after pivot                         | To make it the lowest possible next number       |

## 🧩 Detailed Steps (with variable names)

### 🔹 Step 1: **Find the Valley**

```python
for i in range(len(nums) - 1, 0, -1):
    if nums[i - 1] < nums[i]:
        valley = i - 1
        break
```

* Go from the **right end**, find the first pair where **nums\[i - 1] < nums\[i]**
* This is the **pivot (valley)** — the point where things start going *down*.
* If **not found**, array is in descending order → reverse to get smallest permutation.

---

### 🔹 Step 2: **Find Next Higher and Swap**

```python
while nums[next_higher] <= nums[valley]:
    next_higher -= 1

nums[valley], nums[next_higher] = nums[next_higher], nums[valley]
```

* From the end, find **just larger** element than `nums[valley]`
* Swap it — this gives you a number *just bigger* than the current one

---

### 🔹 Step 3: **Reverse the Right Side**

```python
left = valley + 1
right = len(nums) - 1
while left < right:
    nums[left], nums[right] = nums[right], nums[left]
    left += 1
    right -= 1
```

* After the valley, the right half is in decreasing order
* Reversing it gives the **smallest** arrangement (i.e., next lexicographical order)

## 🧠 Mnemonic:

> "**V-S-R** → Valley, Swap, Reverse"

Repeat it in your head like a chant — just 3 actions.

## 📝 Interview Summary to Say:

> “To compute the next permutation in-place:
>
> 1. I scan from the end to find the first decreasing element — the *pivot*.
> 2. I then find the next larger element to its right and swap them.
> 3. Finally, I reverse the suffix to get the lowest order after the pivot.
>    If no pivot is found, I reverse the entire array, which gives the smallest permutation.”

## 📌 Real-World Analogy

> Imagine you’re trying to get the next bigger lottery number using the same digits.
> You:

1. Find where the digits start decreasing → the last *upward slope*
2. Swap the turning point with the next bigger one
3. Reorder everything after that to be the **smallest possible** (ascending)
