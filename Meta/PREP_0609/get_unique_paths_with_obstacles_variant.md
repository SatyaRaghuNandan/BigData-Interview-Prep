Here's a full explanation with **Telugu-style comments (in English letters)** and detailed logic for the variant:

---

### ‚úÖ Problem:

You are given an `n x n` grid where:

* `0` = free cell
* `1` = obstacle (you cannot pass through)

Return **all possible paths** from top-left `(0,0)` to bottom-right `(n-1,n-1)` using only **Right ('R')** and **Down ('D')** moves.

---

### ‚úÖ Code with Detailed Comments:

```python
def get_unique_paths_with_obstacles(grid):
    result = []
    n = len(grid)

    def backtrack(path, row, col):
        # ‚úÖ Boundary or Obstacle check ‚Äì manaki grid ni vadalali if obstacle or outside bounds
        if row >= n or col >= n or grid[row][col] == 1:
            return

        # ‚úÖ If destination reached ‚Üí path ni add cheyyali
        if row == n - 1 and col == n - 1:
            result.append(path)
            return

        # ‚úÖ Try moving right
        backtrack(path + 'R', row, col + 1)

        # ‚úÖ Try moving down
        backtrack(path + 'D', row + 1, col)

    # ‚úÖ Start from top-left
    backtrack('', 0, 0)
    return result
```

### üß™ Example

```python
grid = [
    [0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0]
]
print(get_unique_paths_with_obstacles(grid))
# Output: ['RRDD', 'RDRD', 'DRRD']
```

> The path `'RDDR'` is blocked because of the obstacle at `(1, 1)`.

---

### ‚è±Ô∏è Time and Space Complexity

* **Time Complexity**: Worst case is `O(2^(2n))`, but actual depends on how many paths are **not** blocked by obstacles.
* **Space Complexity**:

  * Recursion stack: `O(n)` max depth
  * Output list: up to `O(k)` where `k` is the number of valid paths.

---

### ‚úÖ Grid Constraints

* If start or end cell has an obstacle (`grid[0][0] == 1` or `grid[n-1][n-1] == 1`), then result is empty.
* Can be extended to handle **m x n** grids easily by using `len(grid)` and `len(grid[0])`.

---

Let me know if you'd like:

* Version for `m x n` (not just square)
* Path with coordinates instead of `'R'`/`'D'`
* First valid path only instead of all paths
