Excellent! All four of these problems are classic **Binary Search on Answer** types. Letâ€™s go through each one in **Python** with **detailed Telugu comments** and a **structured explanation**.

## âœ… **1011. Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days**

### ðŸ’¡ Idea:

* Guess the minimum capacity of the ship.
* Check if we can ship all packages within `D` days using that capacity.

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], D: int) -> int:
        # Binary Search range: max weight to total weight
        left, right = max(weights), sum(weights)

        def is_feasible(capacity):
            days = 1  # Initial day
            total = 0  # Current day's weight sum
            for weight in weights:
                total += weight
                if total > capacity:
                    days += 1  # New day start
                    total = weight  # Reset with current weight
                    if days > D:
                        return False
            return True

        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if is_feasible(mid):
                right = mid  # Try for smaller capacity
            else:
                left = mid + 1  # Increase capacity

        return left
```

### ðŸ§  Telugu Comments:

```text
- Ship capacity guess cheyyadam (Binary Search)
- Weight list lo D rojullo shipment possible aa chustunnam
- Feasible check lo weight overflow aithe new day start chestam
```

## âœ… **875. Koko Eating Bananas**

### ðŸ’¡ Idea:

* Guess a banana-eating speed.
* Check if she can eat all bananas in `H` hours.

```python
class Solution:
    def minEatingSpeed(self, piles: List[int], H: int) -> int:
        import math

        def can_finish(speed):
            hours = 0
            for pile in piles:
                hours += math.ceil(pile / speed)
            return hours <= H

        left, right = 1, max(piles)
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if can_finish(mid):
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        return left
```

### ðŸ§  Telugu Comments:

```text
- Oka guess speed tho anni piles ni H hours lo finish cheyyagala?
- Yes aithe speed ni thagginchadam (right = mid)
- No aithe speed penchali (left = mid + 1)
```

## âœ… **1482. Minimum Days to Make m Bouquets**

### ðŸ’¡ Idea:

* Youâ€™re given a garden of flowers.
* Find the minimum number of days needed to make `m` bouquets of size `k`.

```python
class Solution:
    def minDays(self, bloomDay: List[int], m: int, k: int) -> int:
        def can_make(days):
            flowers = 0
            bouquets = 0
            for bloom in bloomDay:
                if bloom <= days:
                    flowers += 1
                    if flowers == k:
                        bouquets += 1
                        flowers = 0
                else:
                    flowers = 0
            return bouquets >= m

        if len(bloomDay) < m * k:
            return -1

        left, right = min(bloomDay), max(bloomDay)
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if can_make(mid):
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        return left
```

### ðŸ§  Telugu Comments:

```text
- Days guess chestunnam
- Aa day varaku bloom ayina flowers ni use chesi bouquets prepare cheyyali
- Bouquet = k consecutive flowers
- Possible aithe days ni thaggistam
```

## âœ… **1891. Cutting Ribbons**

### ðŸ’¡ Idea:

* You have ribbons of various lengths.
* Cut them into pieces of length `L` such that you get at least `k` pieces.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxLength(self, ribbons: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        def can_cut(length):
            count = 0
            for ribbon in ribbons:
                count += ribbon // length
            return count >= k

        left, right = 1, max(ribbons)
        result = 0
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if can_cut(mid):
                result = mid
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        return result
```

### ðŸ§  Telugu Comments:

```text
- Ribbon length ni guess cheyyadam
- Aa length tho cut cheyyadam valla minimum k pieces vacchaya chustunnam
- Possible aithe result update cheyyali and search right ki move
```
