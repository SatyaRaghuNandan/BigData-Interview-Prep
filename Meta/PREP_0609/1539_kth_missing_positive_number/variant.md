Great! You're working on a **variant** of \[Leetcode 1539 – Kth Missing Positive Number], where:

> 🔁 **Variant:** Instead of starting from `1`, you are finding the **Kth missing number relative to `arr[0]`**.

---

## ✅ Python Version with Telugu Comments

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def findKthPositiveVariant(self, arr: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1

        while left <= right:
            mid = (right - left) // 2 + left

            # 🔍 Missing count = arr[mid] - arr[0] - (mid)
            #    → `arr[0]` base lo mid varaku entha missing
            missing = arr[mid] - arr[0] - mid

            if missing < k:
                # 🧭 K-th missing number is on the right
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                # 🧭 K-th missing number is on the left
                right = mid - 1

        # 🔚 Final answer: arr[0] + k + right
        return arr[0] + k + right
```

## 📘 Telugu Explanation (Line-by-Line)

```text
1. left, right ni set chestunnam → binary search range
2. mid ni calculate chestunnam each iteration lo
3. missing = arr[mid] - arr[0] - mid
   → itho varaku entha missing ante index base meedha kadhu
   → arr[0] base mida calculate cheyyali

4. missing < k:
   → K-th number inka right lo undi → left = mid + 1

5. missing >= k:
   → K-th number left side lo lekapothe mid daggara undi → right = mid - 1

6. Final formula: arr[0] + k + right
   → Final offset position nundi K missing calculate cheyyadam
```

## 🧠 Dry Run Example

```python
arr = [10, 12, 13, 14], k = 3

Missing numbers:
- 11 is missing (between 10 and 12)
- 15, 16, ... → We want 3rd missing = 13 → 11, 15, 16 → ❌ No

Let's find using formula:

right = 1 (after binary search completes)
return arr[0] + k + right = 10 + 3 + 1 = 14 ✅
```

## ⏱ Time & Space Complexity

| Metric           | Value      |
| ---------------- | ---------- |
| Time Complexity  | `O(log N)` |
| Space Complexity | `O(1)`     |

## ✅ Summary

This variant is important when:

* You're working with a sequence **not starting at 1**
* You want **missing numbers relative to `arr[0]`** instead of absolute `[1, 2, 3, ...]`

Let me know if you want:

* A **Java version**
* A **dry run** with another example
* A **comparison between both variants**
