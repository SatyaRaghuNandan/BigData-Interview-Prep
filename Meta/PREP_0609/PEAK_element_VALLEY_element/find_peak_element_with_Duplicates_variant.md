Excellent question!

You're right: the original `findPeakElement()` logic works **only when adjacent elements are guaranteed to be distinct**, as stated:

> `nums[i] ≠ nums[i + 1]`

This invariant helps ensure that **every strictly increasing slope eventually ends in a peak** and avoids ambiguity.

## ❓ New Variant: **Duplicates Allowed**

If you now allow **duplicates**, i.e. `nums[i] == nums[i+1]` is possible, the earlier approach may **miss valid peaks**, especially in **plateaus**.

### ❗ Example That Breaks Old Logic:

```python
nums = [1, 2, 2, 2, 1]
# Valid peak is at index 1, 2, or 3
# Original binary search may skip the whole plateau
```

---

## ✅ Updated Approach (with Duplicates Allowed)

We need to slightly **modify the binary search**:

* If `nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]`: go left → peak might be `mid`
* If `nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]`: go right
* But if `nums[mid] == nums[mid + 1]`: we **don't know** which side has a peak — so we **explore both** sides safely (bias towards right/left)

---

## ✅ Python Code (Duplicates Allowed)

```python
class Solution:
    def findPeakElementWithDuplicates(self, nums):
        left = 0
        right = len(nums) - 1

        while left < right:
            mid = (right - left) // 2 + left

            if nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]:
                # Increasing → move right
                left = mid + 1
            elif nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]:
                # Decreasing → move left (including mid)
                right = mid
            else:
                # nums[mid] == nums[mid + 1] → unsure, move left by 1 (safe shrink)
                right -= 1  # OR left += 1, both are valid

        return left  # or right, both equal
```

## 🧠 Time and Space Complexity

| Metric           | Value      | Notes                                 |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Time Complexity  | O(n) worst | Due to duplicates causing slow shrink |
| Avg Time         | O(log n)   | If few/no duplicates                  |
| Space Complexity | O(1)       | No extra space used                   |

---

## ✅ Behavior

This modified binary search handles **plateaus** and **flat peaks** like:

* `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]` → returns any of the peak indices 1–3
* `[3, 3, 3, 3]` → all are peaks; returns any valid index

Let me know if you want:

* To **find all** peak indices
* The **Java version**
* Handle **valleys** or **local minima**
