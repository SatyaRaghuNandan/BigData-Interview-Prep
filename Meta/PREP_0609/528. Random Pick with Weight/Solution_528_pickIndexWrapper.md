You're implementing a **variant of Leetcode 528** but in a more real-world context: instead of picking a number based on weight, you're **picking a city based on population**.

---

### ✅ **Problem Summary (Variant of 528):**

Given a list of cities and their populations, randomly pick a city such that the probability of picking a city is proportional to its population.

---

### ✅ **Intuition & Core Idea:**

We simulate this by:

1. **Prefix Sum Array** of populations.
2. **Binary Search** on a randomly selected person number from `0` to `total_population - 1`.

---

### ✅ **Python Version with Telugu Comments:**

```python
import random
from typing import List, Tuple

class SolutionVariant528:
    def __init__(self, city_populations: List[Tuple[str, int]]):
        self.prefix_sums = []
        total = 0
        for city, population in city_populations:
            total += population
            self.prefix_sums.append((city, total))  # Prefix sum build cheyyadam

    def pickIndexWrapper(self, generated_person: int) -> str:
        return self.pickIndex(generated_person)

    def pickIndex(self, override: int) -> str:
        # Random person generate cheyyadam, ledante override ni vadadam
        if override == 0:
            person = random.randint(0, self.prefix_sums[-1][1] - 1)
        else:
            person = override

        # Binary Search lo person ekkada padtado choodali
        left, right = 0, len(self.prefix_sums) - 1
        while left <= right:
            mid = (right - left) // 2 + left
            if person < self.prefix_sums[mid][1]:
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        return self.prefix_sums[left][0]  # city name return cheyyadam

# 🔍 Test Function
def pick_index_test():
    input_data = [("US", 300), ("VN", 100), ("BR", 200)]
    s = SolutionVariant528(input_data)

    # US → 0 to 299
    assert s.pickIndexWrapper(0) == "US"
    assert s.pickIndexWrapper(150) == "US"
    assert s.pickIndexWrapper(299) == "US"

    # VN → 300 to 399
    assert s.pickIndexWrapper(300) == "VN"
    assert s.pickIndexWrapper(375) == "VN"
    assert s.pickIndexWrapper(399) == "VN"

    # BR → 400 to 599
    assert s.pickIndexWrapper(400) == "BR"
    assert s.pickIndexWrapper(420) == "BR"
    assert s.pickIndexWrapper(599) == "BR"

pick_index_test()
```

### 📈 **Time and Space Complexity**

| Operation      | Complexity |
| -------------- | ---------- |
| Constructor    | O(n)       |
| pickIndex      | O(log n)   |
| Space (prefix) | O(n)       |

---

### ✅ Real-World Use Case

You might use this:

* To simulate **city-based sampling** for demographic surveys.
* In **load balancing** where city is mapped to a datacenter and traffic distribution is population-based.

---

Let me know if you'd like to expand this to:

* Handle dynamic city additions
* Track how often each city was picked
* Use floating-point weights instead of integers
