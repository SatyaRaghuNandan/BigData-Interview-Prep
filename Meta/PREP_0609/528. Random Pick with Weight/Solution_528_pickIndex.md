You're implementing a **weighted random picker** using prefix sums and binary searchâ€”this is a classic and optimized solution to Leetcode [528. Random Pick with Weight](https://leetcode.com/problems/random-pick-with-weight/).

---

### âœ… Problem Statement:

Given a list of positive integers `w`, where `w[i]` is the **weight of index i**, design a class `Solution_528` that:

* Randomly picks an index such that the probability of picking index `i` is `w[i] / sum(w)`.

---

### ðŸ§  Core Idea:

1. **Prefix Sum Array**:
   Compute a prefix sum where each index represents the accumulated weight up to that point.

2. **Binary Search**:
   Generate a random number in the range `[0, total_weight - 1]` and use binary search to find the smallest index such that `prefix_sum[index] > roll`.

### ðŸ“˜ C++ to Python Conversion with Detailed Comments in Telugu

```python
import random
from typing import List

class Solution_528:
    def __init__(self, w: List[int]):
        self.prefix_sums = []
        total = 0
        for weight in w:
            # Total sum ni accumulate cheyyadam and prefix_sum list lo store cheyyadam
            total += weight
            self.prefix_sums.append(total)

    def pickIndex(self) -> int:
        # Random roll [0, total_sum - 1] range lo generate cheyyadam
        roll = random.randint(0, self.prefix_sums[-1] - 1)
        
        # Binary search to find first index where roll < prefix_sums[mid]
        left = 0
        right = len(self.prefix_sums) - 1
        while left <= right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if roll < self.prefix_sums[mid]:
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        return left
```

### ðŸ“Š Time and Space Complexity

| Operation   | Complexity |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| Constructor | O(n)       |
| pickIndex() | O(log n)   |
| Space       | O(n)       |

---

### âœ… Example

```python
sol = Solution_528([1, 3, 2])
# Total weight = 6, probability:
# index 0 â†’ 1/6, index 1 â†’ 3/6, index 2 â†’ 2/6

counts = [0, 0, 0]
for _ in range(10000):
    counts[sol.pickIndex()] += 1
print(counts)  # Should reflect weights approximately
```

Let me know if you'd like a variant that:

* Allows dynamic updates to weights,
* Supports picking `k` items without replacement, or
* Uses floating-point weights.
