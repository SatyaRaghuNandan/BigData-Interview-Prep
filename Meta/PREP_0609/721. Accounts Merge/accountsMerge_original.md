Here's a **detailed explanation and walkthrough** of the `accountsMerge` code you posted, including **comments and conceptual breakdown** of what each part is doing. This is a popular Union-Find / DFS problem from LeetCode (Problem #721).

### âœ… Problem Summary

Given a list of accounts (where each account has a name and list of emails), merge accounts belonging to the same person if they share at least **one email in common**.

### âœ… Code with Detailed Comments

```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def accountsMerge(self, accounts: List[List[str]]) -> List[List[str]]:
        # ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Build the graph (undirected)
        # Each email is a node. If two emails appear in the same account, add an edge.
        adj = defaultdict(list)  # Adjacency list: email -> list of connected emails

        for account in accounts:
            emails = account[1:]            # Ignore the name
            canonical = emails[0]          # Use the first email as the base node
            for email in emails[1:]:
                adj[canonical].append(email)
                adj[email].append(canonical)
                # Connect email <-> canonical (bi-directional)

        visited = set()

        # ðŸ”¹ Step 2: DFS to gather all connected emails (connected component)
        def dfs(email, same_emails: List[str]):
            visited.add(email)
            same_emails.append(email)
            for nei in adj[email]:
                if nei not in visited:
                    dfs(nei, same_emails)

        merged = []

        # ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Loop over original accounts and collect connected components
        for account in accounts:
            emails = account[1:]
            name = account[0]
            if emails[0] in visited:
                continue  # Already visited this component
            same_emails = []
            dfs(emails[0], same_emails)
            merged.append([name] + sorted(same_emails))  # Sort the emails alphabetically

        return merged
```

### ðŸ§ª Example Input

```python
accounts = [
    ["John", "johnsmith@mail.com", "john_newyork@mail.com"],
    ["John", "johnsmith@mail.com", "john00@mail.com"],
    ["Mary", "mary@mail.com"],
    ["John", "johnnybravo@mail.com"]
]
```

### âœ… Output

```python
[
    ["John", "john00@mail.com", "john_newyork@mail.com", "johnsmith@mail.com"],
    ["Mary", "mary@mail.com"],
    ["John", "johnnybravo@mail.com"]
]
```

### ðŸ’¡ Key Ideas

* **Graph-based DFS**: Treat each email as a node. If two emails appear in the same account, connect them. Use DFS to find all connected emails.
* **Connected Components**: Each set of connected emails belongs to the same person.
* **Email â†’ Account Mapping**: The account name is preserved using the first appearance.

---

### ðŸ§  Why This Works?

If multiple accounts share at least **one email**, they are merged into the same connected component (graph cluster). DFS is used to traverse and collect all emails in the same component.
