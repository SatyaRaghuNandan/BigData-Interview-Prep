Here’s a detailed comparison and breakdown of the **four approaches** to solve the **"Find Kth Largest Element in an Array"** problem:

---

### ✅ **Approach 1: Sorting**

```python
class Solution:
    def findKthLargest(self, nums, k):
        nums.sort(reverse=True)
        return nums[k - 1]
```

#### 🔍 Explanation (English):

* Sort the array in descending order.
* The Kth largest is at index `k-1`.

#### 🧠 Time Complexity:

* `O(n log n)` for sorting

#### 💾 Space Complexity:

* `O(1)` (in-place sort), or `O(n)` if not in-place

#### 🔥 Interview Use:

* Simple, but **not optimal**.
* OK for quick explanation, but not ideal for large datasets.

---

### ✅ **Approach 2: Min-Heap**

```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def findKthLargest(self, nums, k):
        heap = []
        for num in nums:
            heapq.heappush(heap, num)
            if len(heap) > k:
                heapq.heappop(heap)
        return heap[0]
```

#### 🔍 Explanation:

* Maintain a **min-heap** of size `k`.
* Push each number. If the heap exceeds size `k`, pop the smallest.
* The smallest in the heap is the **kth largest overall**.

#### 🧠 Time Complexity:

* `O(n log k)`

#### 💾 Space Complexity:

* `O(k)` for the heap

#### 🔥 Interview Use:

* ✅ **Preferred for Meta interviews**
* Efficient and elegant.
* Use when `k` is small and input is large.

### ✅ **Approach 3: Quickselect (Hoare's Selection Algorithm)**

```python
import random

class Solution:
    def findKthLargest(self, nums, k):
        def quick_select(nums, k):
            pivot = random.choice(nums)
            left, mid, right = [], [], []

            for num in nums:
                if num > pivot:
                    left.append(num)
                elif num < pivot:
                    right.append(num)
                else:
                    mid.append(num)

            if k <= len(left):
                return quick_select(left, k)
            elif len(left) + len(mid) < k:
                return quick_select(right, k - len(left) - len(mid))
            else:
                return pivot

        return quick_select(nums, k)
```

#### 🔍 Explanation:

* Similar to QuickSort.
* Uses **random pivot** to partition.
* Focuses only on the partition where the Kth largest lies.

#### 🧠 Time Complexity:

* Average: `O(n)`
* Worst-case: `O(n^2)` (if pivoting is poor)

#### 💾 Space Complexity:

* `O(n)` due to recursion and list partitions

#### 🔥 Interview Use:

* ✅ Good if you mention trade-offs and randomized pivoting
* Often appreciated for algorithmic insight
* Not preferred if interview strictly avoids recursion/extra memory

---

### ✅ **Approach 4: Counting Sort (if range is small)**

```python
class Solution:
    def findKthLargest(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        min_value = min(nums)
        max_value = max(nums)
        count = [0] * (max_value - min_value + 1)

        for num in nums:
            count[num - min_value] += 1

        remain = k
        for num in range(len(count) - 1, -1, -1):
            remain -= count[num]
            if remain <= 0:
                return num + min_value
        return -1
```

#### 🔍 Explanation:

* Frequency array for the range of values.
* Count how many times each number appears.
* Walk from the largest down to find the kth largest.

#### 🧠 Time Complexity:

* `O(n + R)`, where R = range from min to max element

#### 💾 Space Complexity:

* `O(R)`

#### 🔥 Interview Use:

* ⚠️ Use **only if range is known and small**
* Efficient but impractical for large ranges (e.g. `[-10^9, 10^9]`)

### ✅ Summary Table

| Approach      | Time Complexity       | Space Complexity | Use in Interview? | Notes                            |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Sorting       | O(n log n)            | O(1) or O(n)     | ❌ Too basic       | Easy but not efficient           |
| Min Heap      | O(n log k)            | O(k)             | ✅ Recommended     | Great balance                    |
| Quickselect   | O(n) avg, O(n²) worst | O(n)             | ✅ Advanced pick   | Tradeoff: recursion & randomness |
| Counting Sort | O(n + R)              | O(R)             | ⚠️ Conditional    | Use if `R` is small              |

### ✅ Meta Interview Recommendation:

* **Start with heap** → explain why it's optimal for space/time.
* **Discuss quickselect** if interviewer wants deeper algorithmic reasoning.
* Only **mention counting sort** if range is narrow or constrained.

Let me know if you’d like visual dry runs, code tracing, or Java equivalents.
