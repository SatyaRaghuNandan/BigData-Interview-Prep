Your `findPeakElement` function is correct and efficiently implements a **binary search-based approach** to find any **peak element** index in a 1D array. Let me break it down clearly for you, including:

---

### ‚úÖ What This Code Does:

It finds a **peak element**, which is defined as:

* `nums[i]` such that:

  * `nums[i - 1] < nums[i] > nums[i + 1]`
  * Edge elements are valid peaks too (e.g., `nums[0] > nums[1]`)

This implementation returns **any one** peak index using **binary search**, which guarantees:

* **Time Complexity**: `O(log n)`
* **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`

### üìù Code with Detailed Telugu Comments (Transliterated):

```python
class Solution:
    def findPeakElement(self, nums):
        left = 0
        right = len(nums) - 1
        
        while left <= right:
            # Mid calculate cheyyadam ‚Äì overflow avoid cheyyadaniki
            mid = (right - left) // 2 + left

            # Check if mid oka peak element
            if (mid == len(nums) - 1 or nums[mid + 1] < nums[mid]) and \
               (mid == 0 or nums[mid - 1] < nums[mid]):
                return mid  # Idi oka valid peak

            # Right neighbor ekkuva undi ante ‚Üí peak right side lo untadi
            if nums[mid + 1] > nums[mid]:
                left = mid + 1  # Search in right half
            else:
                right = mid - 1  # Search in left half

        return -1  # Ideally unreachable
```

---

### üîç Example Runs:

```python
nums = [1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 6, 4]
# Possible outputs: 1 or 5 (both are peaks)

nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]
# Output: 2 (3 is a peak)

nums = [3, 4, 5, 1]
# Output: 2 (5 is a peak)
```

---

### üîê Safety Note:

* The line `nums[mid + 1] > nums[mid]` is **safe** because:

  * You only access `nums[mid + 1]` when `mid < len(nums) - 1` because of the `if` structure before.

But to make it safer in **strict coding interviews**, you could slightly adjust the logic to explicitly check bounds before accessing:

```python
if mid < len(nums) - 1 and nums[mid + 1] > nums[mid]:
    left = mid + 1
else:
    right = mid - 1
```
