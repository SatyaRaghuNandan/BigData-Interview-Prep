### System Design: Newsfeed Breakdown

The goal is to design a Newsfeed system where users can follow others unidirectionally and view a chronological feed of posts. The design follows the **Hello Interview delivery framework**, which emphasizes a structured approach to system design interviews: Requirements, Core Entities, API Design, High-Level Design, and Deep Dives.

#### 1. Requirements

**Functional Requirements:**
- **Create Posts**: Users can create posts with content.
- **Follow Users**: Users can follow others to see their posts.
- **View Feed**: Users can view a chronological feed of posts from accounts they follow.
- **Pagination**: Support infinite scrolling with paginated feeds (e.g., 25 posts per page).

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- **Eventual Consistency**: Posts should appear in feeds within ~1 minute.
- **Low Latency**: Target ~500ms for posting and feed retrieval.
- **Scale**: Support ~2 billion users.
- **Simplicity**: Start with a minimal system, then optimize for bottlenecks.

**Out of Scope (Bonus Features):**
- Likes, comments, privacy settings (to keep the design focused).

#### 2. Core Entities

The core entities (nouns) in the system are:
- **User**: Represents an account.
- **Post**: Contains content, creator ID, and creation timestamp.
- **Follow**: Represents a unidirectional relationship between users (user A follows user B).

No detailed schema is defined initially, but attributes are added during the design phase.

#### 3. API Design

The APIs are designed to cover the functional requirements using REST conventions:
1. **Create Post**:
   - `POST /posts`
   - Body: `{ content: string }`
   - Response: `201 Created`, returns `{ postId: string }`
2. **Follow User**:
   - `PUT /users/:userId/followers`
   - No body needed (assumes follower ID is derived from the authenticated user).
   - Response: `200 OK`
3. **Get Feed**:
   - `GET /feed?pageSize=25&cursor=timestamp`
   - Response: `{ posts: [{ postId: string, content: string, createdAt: timestamp }], nextCursor: timestamp }`
   - Uses a cursor (timestamp) for pagination to fetch posts older than the cursor.

REST is chosen for its industry-standard simplicity, though gRPC or function signatures could be alternatives.

#### 4. High-Level Design

The initial design aims to satisfy functional requirements with minimal complexity, acknowledging scalability issues to address later.

**Components:**
- **API Gateway + Load Balancer**: Routes client requests to services.
- **Post Service**:
  - Handles `POST /posts`.
  - Stores posts in a DynamoDB table (`Posts`) with:
    - **Primary Key**: `postId`.
    - **Global Secondary Index (GSI)**: `creatorId` (partition key), `createdAt` (sort key) for fetching posts by user.
- **Follow Service**:
  - Handles `PUT /users/:userId/followers`.
  - Stores relationships in a DynamoDB table (`Follows`) with:
    - **Primary Key**: `userFollowing` (partition key), `userFollowed` (sort key).
    - **GSI**: `userFollowed` (partition key), `userFollowing` (sort key) to query followers of a user.
    - Supports queries like “Who does user A follow?” and “Who follows user B?”.
- **Feed Service**:
  - Handles `GET /feed`.
  - Steps:
    1. Query `Follows` table to get users followed by the requester.
    2. Query `Posts` GSI for recent posts from each followed user, filtered by `cursor` timestamp.
    3. Merge and sort posts by `createdAt`, return up to `pageSize` posts with a `nextCursor`.
- **Database**: DynamoDB (or similar scalable wide-column store like Cassandra) for `Posts` and `Follows` tables.

**Issues Noted for Deep Dive:**
- **Scalability**: Querying posts for users following many accounts (e.g., 10,000) requires numerous requests and heavy merging.
- **Pagination**: Handled via cursor-based filtering.
- **Hot Keys**: Not addressed yet (e.g., popular accounts causing spikes in post reads).

#### 5. Deep Dives

This section addresses bottlenecks and scalability challenges, focusing on the feed generation process and hotkey issues.

**Bottleneck 1: Feed Generation for Users Following Many Accounts**
- **Problem**: If a user follows 10,000 accounts, the Feed Service makes 10,000 queries to the `Posts` GSI, retrieves millions of posts, and merges them in real-time, leading to high latency and resource usage.
- **Solution**: Precompute feeds using a **fan-out-on-write** approach:
  - Add a `PrecomputedFeed` table in DynamoDB:
    - **Partition Key**: `userId` (the user whose feed is being computed).
    - **Sort Key**: `postId`.
    - Stores the latest ~200 post IDs per user (~2KB per user, 2TB for 2 billion users).
  - When a post is created:
    1. Post Service writes to `Posts` table.
    2. Asynchronously enqueue a job to a **worker pool** (using a queue like SQS).
    3. Workers read the `Follows` GSI to get all followers of the post’s creator.
    4. For each follower, write the `postId` to their `PrecomputedFeed` entry.
  - Feed Service now queries `PrecomputedFeed` for a user’s feed, which is much faster.
- **Challenge**: Accounts with millions of followers (e.g., celebrities) generate massive write loads when posting.
- **Refinement**: Add a `precomputed` flag to the `Follows` table:
  - Set to `true` for accounts with >100,000 followers.
  - For these accounts, use the async fan-out to write to `PrecomputedFeed`.
  - For accounts with fewer followers, skip precomputation.
  - Feed Service:
    1. Queries `PrecomputedFeed` for precomputed posts.
    2. Queries `Posts` GSI for non-precomputed follows (small accounts).
    3. Merges both lists at runtime.
  - This hybrid approach caps write load for mega accounts and reduces read-time computation.

**Bottleneck 2: Hotkey Problem for Popular Posts**
- **Problem**: When a popular account (e.g., Justin Bieber) posts, millions of users query the same `postId` in the `Posts` table, causing throttling in DynamoDB due to uneven load on a single partition (hotkey).
- **Solution**: Use a distributed cache (e.g., Redis) with a Least Frequently Used (LFU) eviction policy and short Time-to-Live (TTL):
  - Cache stores only the most viral posts.
  - Feed Service checks the cache before querying DynamoDB, reducing load on the `Posts` table.
- **Challenge**: The cache itself can develop a hotkey if sharded by `postId`, as all requests hit the same cache instance.
- **Refinement**: Use multiple cache instances (non-replicated):
  - Feed Service randomly selects a cache instance for each request.
  - If the post is not in the selected cache, it fetches from DynamoDB and caches it.
  - This spreads load across `n` cache instances, reducing hotkey impact (e.g., `n` requests hit DynamoDB instead of millions).
- **Trade-off**: Cache misses increase DynamoDB load slightly, but `n` is small compared to total requests.

**Additional Considerations (Not Fully Explored):**
- **Unfollows**: Remove posts from `PrecomputedFeed` when a user unfollows another.
- **Edge Cases**: Users following many large accounts may still face read-time merging issues.
- **Product Limits**: Cap follow counts or feed depth (e.g., LinkedIn limits connections) to avoid engineering for rare cases.

#### 6. Summary

The design satisfies the functional requirements with:
- A simple **Post Service** for creating posts.
- A **Follow Service** for managing relationships.
- A **Feed Service** that initially queries posts dynamically but is optimized with a **precomputed feed table** and **async worker pool** for scalability.
- A **distributed cache** to mitigate hotkey issues for popular posts.

Key concepts covered:
- **Fan-out-on-write**: Precompute feeds to reduce read-time latency.
- **Async processing**: Use queues and workers to handle large write loads.
- **Hotkey mitigation**: Distribute cache load to avoid throttling.
- **Data modeling**: Use GSIs for efficient queries and precomputed tables for performance.

This design is a solid foundation for a Newsfeed system, adaptable to interviewer follow-ups (e.g., handling unfollows, cache consistency, or ML-based ranking).
