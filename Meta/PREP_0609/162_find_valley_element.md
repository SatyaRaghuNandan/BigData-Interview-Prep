You're working with an excellent **variant of the "Find Peak Element" problem**, which searches for a **Valley Element** — an element **smaller than both neighbors**.

Let’s go over this implementation in full detail, with:

---

### ✅ What’s a **Valley Element**?

A **valley** is an index `i` such that:

```python
nums[i] < nums[i - 1] and nums[i] < nums[i + 1]
```

For edge cases:

* We treat `nums[-1]` and `nums[len]` as **positive infinity** (`+∞`)
* So, the **first** or **last** element can be a valley.

### ✅ Your Code — Annotated & Explained

```python
def findValleyElement(nums):
    left = 0
    right = len(nums) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (right - left) // 2 + left  # Calculate midpoint safely

        # Check if current element is a valid valley:
        if (mid == len(nums) - 1 or nums[mid + 1] > nums[mid]) and \
           (mid == 0 or nums[mid - 1] > nums[mid]):
            return mid  # mid is a valley

        # If right neighbor is smaller, valley might be on right
        if nums[mid + 1] < nums[mid]:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            # Otherwise valley might be on left
            right = mid - 1

    return -1  # Should never happen if input has at least one valley



def findValleyElement(nums):
    left = 0
    right = len(nums) - 1

    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2

        # If right side is smaller, valley must be on the right
        if nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            # Left side (or mid itself) could be the valley
            right = mid

    return left  # or return nums[left] if value needed



```

### 🧠 Logic (in Telugu - Transliterated):

```text
- mid element ni valley cheyyali ante:
  - mid ki left and right neighbors kanna thakkuva undaali.
  - mid = 0 ayite left side +∞ laga treat chestham.
  - mid = n - 1 ayite right side +∞ laga treat chestham.
  
- Right neighbor chinna undi ante valley right lo vundachu → left = mid + 1
- Otherwise valley left lo vundachu → right = mid - 1
```

### 🧪 Test Case Walkthroughs

#### 1. `nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]`

* Index 0 is smaller than `nums[1] = 2`
* Treated as valley because left is `+∞` → ✅

#### 2. `nums = [1, 2, 3, 5, 3, 4, 3, 1, 6]`

* Index 4: `nums[4] = 3 < nums[3] = 5` and `nums[4] < nums[5] = 4` → ✅

#### 3. `nums = [3, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2]`

* Index 1: `nums[1] = 2` is smaller than `nums[0] = 3` and `nums[2] = 3` → ✅

#### 4. `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2]`

* Index 0 is smaller than `nums[1] = 2` and treated as valley → ✅

#### 5. `nums = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0]`

* Index 5: `nums[5] = 0` is last element → treated as right `+∞` → valid valley → ✅

#### 6. `nums = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 6]`

* Index 4: `nums[4] = 1` is less than both `nums[3] = 2`, `nums[5] = 6` → ✅

### ⏱️ Time and Space Complexity

| Metric           | Value      |
| ---------------- | ---------- |
| Time Complexity  | `O(log n)` |
| Space Complexity | `O(1)`     |

### ✅ Summary

| Feature         | Explanation                               |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Edge Safe       | Yes, due to `mid == 0` and `mid == n - 1` |
| Direction Logic | Always moves toward decreasing slope      |
| Binary Search   | Yes, efficient `O(log n)`                 |
| Edge Handling   | Treats out-of-bound as `+∞`               |

Would you like to **combine both peak & valley detection**, or extend this logic to a **2D grid** (like "Find Valley in Matrix")?
