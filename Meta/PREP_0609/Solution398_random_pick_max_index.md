You're implementing a **Reservoir Sampling** variant specifically optimized to **pick one random index of the maximum element** in an array. Let's walk through the logic and then provide the Python version with detailed Telugu comments.

## 🔁 Problem Statement (Variant):

> Given an array `nums`, randomly return **one of the indices** of the **maximum element**.
> All indices of the maximum element should have equal probability.

## ✅ Python Version with Telugu Comments

```python
import random
from typing import List

def random_pick_max_index(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    max_number = float('-inf')  # Initial ga maximum value chinna value tho start cheyyali
    picked_index = -1           # Final ga return cheyyali index
    count = 0                   # Max element ochina count ni track cheyyadam kosam

    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        if num < max_number:
            continue  # Max kanna thakkuva unte skip cheyyali

        if num > max_number:
            # Kotha maximum vachesindi, so reset everything
            max_number = num
            picked_index = i
            count = 1
        elif num == max_number:
            # Same max vachesindi, random ga pick cheyyali using probability
            count += 1
            if random.randint(0, count - 1) == 0:
                picked_index = i

    return picked_index
```

## 🧠 Explanation (Reservoir Sampling for Max Value):

1. Track the **maximum value** encountered so far.
2. For every occurrence of that max value:

   * Maintain a count `n`.
   * Replace the selected index with probability `1/n`.

This ensures all max-value indices have equal chance.

### 📊 Time and Space Complexity

| Operation        | Complexity |
| ---------------- | ---------- |
| Time Complexity  | O(n)       |
| Space Complexity | O(1)       |

---

## ✅ Example

```python
nums = [1, 3, 5, 5, 2, 5]
print(random_pick_max_index(nums))  # Should return index 2, 3, or 5 randomly
```

Let me know if you'd like a version that returns **all indices** of the max or performs this for **minimum values** instead.
