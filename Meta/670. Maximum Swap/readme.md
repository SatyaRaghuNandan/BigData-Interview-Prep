You're asking a **great question** about the **difference in strategy** between the `maximumSwap` approach and the `buildSecondLargestNumber` variant. Let’s break it down step by step 👇

---

## ✅ Why `maximumSwap` uses `rightMostIndex[]`?

### 🔹 Problem goal:

> Swap **two digits at most once** to get the **maximum possible number**.

### 🔹 Key insight:

To maximize the number:

* For each digit from **left to right**, try to find the **largest digit** on the **right** and swap.

### 🔹 That’s why we do:

```java
int[] rightMostIndex = new int[10];
for (int i = 0; i < digits.length; i++) {
    rightMostIndex[digits[i] - '0'] = i;
}
```

This tells:

* "Where is the **last occurrence** of 9? 8? …" so that if a **bigger digit exists later**, you can swap to increase value.

---

## ✅ Why `buildSecondLargestNumber` uses `frequency[]`?

### 🔹 Goal here:

> Build the **second-largest number** by rearranging all digits (not just a single swap originally).

So:

1. It creates the **largest number first** (by sorting digits descending using `frequency[]`).
2. Then finds the **first mismatch** from the back and swaps to make it *just slightly* smaller.

Hence:

```java
for (int d = 9; d >= 0; d--) {
    for (int i = 0; i < freq[d]; i++) {
        largest.add(d);
    }
}
```

This **does not preserve original digit positions**, so you lose info like "rightmost index" and cannot apply the same strategy as in `maximumSwap`.

## 🆚 Comparison Table

| Feature                | `maximumSwap`                                 | `buildSecondLargestNumber`                         |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Input type             | Integer (as digits)                           | Array of digits (list form)                        |
| Output                 | Maximum number after **1 swap**               | Second-largest number by swapping **last unequal** |
| Logic used             | Greedy + `rightMostIndex` tracking            | Frequency count + reverse swap                     |
| Preserves digit order? | ✅ Yes                                         | ❌ No (it rebuilds the number from sorted digits)   |
| Swap strategy          | Left to right → swap with largest right digit | Right to left → swap first adjacent unequal digits |

---

## ✅ Why We Used `frequency[]` in Variant?

> Because we **rebuild** the largest number from scratch by sorting digits, then we try to downgrade it just once — no need to know where each digit originally came from.

But if you want a **`secondMaximumSwap()`** function that:

* Takes an integer
* Uses **original digit positions**
* Returns second-largest **by exactly one swap**

Then yes ✅ you should use `rightMostIndex[]`, just like in `maximumSwap`, and tweak logic to skip the *first* max-improving swap and go to the *second best* one.

---

## 👉 Final Note:

* `rightMostIndex[]` = best when you want to **maximize using original positions**.
* `frequency[]` = best when you're okay to **rebuild digits**, like sorting.

Let me know if you want a `secondMaximumSwap()` version that still preserves order and uses `rightMostIndex[]` logic but chooses the **second-best swap** 💡


Absolutely 💯 — let’s walk through:

## ✅ 1. `maximumSwap` – Approach & Complexity

### 🔹 **Plain English Explanation**:

1. First, convert the number to a character array so we can access individual digits.
2. Then, store the **rightmost index** of each digit (0 to 9).
3. From left to right, try to find if there's any **larger digit** on the **right** — and swap once to get a bigger number.
4. As soon as one swap is made, convert the digits back to an integer and return.

### 🧠 Why it works?

We only need **one greedy swap** to get the **maximum number**.

### 🔹 **Time and Space Complexity**:

| Metric           | Value  | Notes                                      |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Time Complexity  | `O(n)` | One pass for index map, one pass for swap  |
| Space Complexity | `O(1)` | Array of size 10 (fixed), no extra storage |

---

## ✅ 2. `buildSecondLargestNumber` – Approach & Complexity

### 🔹 **Plain English Explanation**:

1. Count how many times each digit (0–9) occurs using a frequency array.
2. Use that frequency to **build the largest number** possible (just like sorting digits in descending order).
3. Then move from right to left, and find the **first unequal adjacent pair** — swap them to slightly reduce the value.
4. Convert the final digit list back to a number and return.

### 🧠 Why it works?

It builds the biggest number and **makes one downgrade** to get the **second-best**.

## 🧠 Interview Talking Tips

If you're in a Meta or FAANG interview, say something like:

> In the original `maximumSwap`, we use a greedy strategy: for each digit from left to right, we try to find a higher digit later and swap to maximize the number. We track the **rightmost index of each digit** so we can make this decision in O(1). It runs in O(n) time with O(1) space since digits range only from 0–9.

> For the second-largest number variant, we take a different approach. We **rebuild the largest number** using digit frequencies, and then swap the **last unequal adjacent digits** to slightly reduce the number. This gives us the second-best value possible with one simple downgrade.

Let me know if you want to explore **"third best"** or **all k variants** using permutations or min-heaps.
