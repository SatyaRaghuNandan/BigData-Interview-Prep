Absolutely! Here's how you can **explain each of the three problems** in a **verbal, interview-style manner** ‚Äî covering the **core logic**, **intuition**, and **code approach** for each.

---

### ‚úÖ **Leetcode 121 ‚Äî Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (One Transaction)**

> **Question:** You are given an array where `prices[i]` is the price of a stock on day `i`. You can **only buy and sell once**. Find the maximum profit you can achieve.

---

### üîä **Interview Explanation:**

> "The key observation is that to maximize profit, I need to **buy at the lowest point** and **sell at a later higher point**. So I track the minimum price seen so far while iterating, and for each day I calculate `current price - min price so far`. I update max profit accordingly."

### üß† Code Logic:

* Initialize `minPrice = ‚àû`
* For each price:

  * Update `minPrice` if current price is smaller
  * Calculate `profit = current price - minPrice`
  * Track the `maxProfit`

### ‚è± Time: `O(N)`‚ÄÉ|‚ÄÉüì¶ Space: `O(1)`

---

### ‚úÖ **Leetcode 122 ‚Äî Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II (Unlimited Transactions)**

> **Question:** You may complete as many transactions as you like (buy/sell multiple times), but you must sell before buying again.

---

### üîä **Interview Explanation:**

> "We‚Äôre allowed multiple transactions, so I treat every **ascending pair of days as profit**. If today‚Äôs price is more than yesterday‚Äôs, I can just buy yesterday and sell today for that gain. I accumulate all such gains over the array."

### üß† Code Logic:

* Loop through prices
* If `price[i] > price[i-1]`, then `profit += price[i] - price[i-1]`

### ‚è± Time: `O(N)`‚ÄÉ|‚ÄÉüì¶ Space: `O(1)`

---

### ‚úÖ **Leetcode 123 ‚Äî Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III (At Most Two Transactions)**

> **Question:** You may complete at most two transactions. Find the maximum profit.

---

### üîä **Interview Explanation:**

> "Here we are limited to **2 transactions max**, so I track two pairs of states:
>
> * `buy1` and `sell1` ‚Üí best profit after 1st transaction
> * `buy2` and `sell2` ‚Üí best profit after 2nd transaction
>
> I simulate buying twice and selling twice in a loop:
>
> * When I 'buy1', I want to minimize price
> * When I 'sell1', I calculate profit = price - buy1
> * When I 'buy2', I want to use profit from sell1
> * When I 'sell2', I get max final profit"

### üß† Code Logic:

```java
buy1 = Integer.MIN_VALUE
sell1 = 0
buy2 = Integer.MIN_VALUE
sell2 = 0

for price in prices:
    buy1 = max(buy1, -price)
    sell1 = max(sell1, buy1 + price)
    buy2 = max(buy2, sell1 - price)
    sell2 = max(sell2, buy2 + price)
```

* Final answer is `sell2`

| Problem | Max Transactions | Strategy                       | Time | Space |
| ------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------ | ---- | ----- |
| LC 121  | 1                | Track min price and max profit | O(N) | O(1)  |

Great question! Let's break down the **difference between Leetcode 121** and **Leetcode 122** ‚Äì both are about buying and selling stocks, but they follow **different trading rules**:

---

## üß† **Leetcode 121: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock**

> üìå **You are allowed to make only *one* transaction.**
> That means: **Buy once, Sell once.**

### ‚úÖ Goal:

> Maximize profit by choosing **one best day to buy** and **one best day to sell after it.**

---

### ‚ú® Example:

```
Input: prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy at 1, Sell at 6 ‚Üí Profit = 5
```

---

### üîç Logic:

* Track the **minimum price so far**
* At each day, compute `price - min_price` and update max profit

---

### ‚úÖ Time: O(n), Space: O(1)

---

---

## üß† **Leetcode 122: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II**

> üìå **You can make as many transactions as you want.**
> But: **You must sell before you buy again.**

### ‚úÖ Goal:

> Maximize profit by making **multiple buys and sells** ‚Äî i.e., profit from **every price increase**.

---

### ‚ú® Example:

```
Input: prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
Output: 7
Explanation:
Buy at 1, Sell at 5 ‚Üí Profit = 4
Buy at 3, Sell at 6 ‚Üí Profit = 3
Total Profit = 4 + 3 = 7
```

---

### üîç Logic:

* Whenever `prices[i] > prices[i-1]`, buy at `i-1` and sell at `i`
* Add all positive differences

---

### ‚úÖ Time: O(n), Space: O(1)

## üîÅ Summary Comparison

| Feature                      | LC 121 (Buy & Sell I)       | LC 122 (Buy & Sell II)    |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Transactions allowed         | 1                           | Unlimited                 |
| Buy before Sell required     | ‚úÖ Yes                       | ‚úÖ Yes                     |

| Greedy possible?             | ‚ùå No, needs tracking        | ‚úÖ Yes, local peak/valley  |
| Output (for `[7,1,5,3,6,4]`) | 5                           | 7                         |

* A side-by-side dry run
* Or to explore dynamic programming variants (LC 123, 188, 309, etc.)



Excellent! Let‚Äôs now compare **Leetcode 123: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III** with **Leetcode 121 and 122** so you clearly understand the difference in constraints and strategies.

---

## ‚úÖ **Problem Comparison Table**

| Problem | Max Transactions       | Greedy Allowed? | Core Strategy                                |
| ------- | ---------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **121** | 1 transaction          | ‚úÖ Yes           | Track min-price and max-profit               |
| **122** | Unlimited              | ‚úÖ Yes           | Add every local profit (greedy)              |
| **123** | Max **2 transactions** | ‚ùå No            | Use **Dynamic Programming** to track profits |

---

## üß† **Leetcode 123: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III**

### üìå You are allowed to **buy and sell at most *two times***

* But you must **sell before you buy again**.
* Transactions must be in order: Buy ‚Üí Sell ‚Üí Buy ‚Üí Sell

---

### ‚ú® Example:

```text
Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation:
Buy at 0, sell at 3 ‚Üí Profit = 3
Buy at 1, sell at 4 ‚Üí Profit = 3
Total = 6
```

---

## üîç Key Insight:

You want to **maximize the sum of profits from 2 non-overlapping transactions.**

### ‚ùå Can't use greedy:

* Because you might need to **skip a small profit now** to make a **bigger profit later**.

---

## ‚úÖ DP Solution Idea:

Track 4 states:

| Variable | Meaning                                       |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `buy1`   | Max profit after 1st **buy** (initially `-‚àû`) |
| `sell1`  | Max profit after 1st **sell**                 |
| `buy2`   | Max profit after 2nd **buy** (after 1st sell) |
| `sell2`  | Max profit after 2nd **sell**                 |

### Transition:

```java
buy1  = max(buy1, -price);
sell1 = max(sell1, buy1 + price);
buy2  = max(buy2, sell1 - price);
sell2 = max(sell2, buy2 + price);
```

---

## üßÆ Dry Run:

```
prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]

buy1  = -3
sell1 = 0
buy2  = -3
sell2 = 0

‚Üí sell1 peaks at 3, sell2 peaks at 6 ‚Üí ‚úÖ
```

---

## ‚úÖ Time & Space Complexity

| Metric    | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| **Time**  | O(n)  |
| **Space** | O(1)  |

> We only track 4 variables throughout.

---

## üîÅ Comparison Recap

| Problem | Max Transactions | Strategy        | Greedy? | Time |
| ------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ------- | ---- |
| LC 121  | 1                | Track min price | ‚úÖ Yes   | O(n) |
| LC 122  | Unlimited        | Local gains     | ‚úÖ Yes   | O(n) |
| LC 123  | 2                | DP (4 vars)     | ‚ùå No    | O(n) |
