Perfect! Let’s go step-by-step through the **Shortest Bridge** problem (Leetcode 934) with:

* ✅ Multiple approaches in plain English
* ✅ Why BFS is better here
* ✅ Optimized solution with clean variable names and Telugu comments
* ✅ Time & space complexity
* ✅ Dry run and edge cases

---

## 🧠 Problem Summary (Plain English)

You are given a `grid` with exactly **two islands**. Each island is made up of 1s (`land`) and surrounded by 0s (`water`).

Your task is to:

> **Find the minimum number of 0s you need to flip to 1** to **connect** the two islands.

You are allowed to **flip only 0s**, and can move **up, down, left, right** (no diagonals).

---

## ✅ Multiple Approaches

---

### 🔹 Approach 1: DFS for first island, then BFS to reach second island ✅ (Best)

1. Use **DFS** to find the **first island** and mark all its cells.
2. Then, use **BFS** from those cells to **expand layer by layer** until you reach the second island.
3. The number of layers traversed = **minimum flips needed**.

✅ Efficient
✅ Clear logic
✅ Guaranteed shortest path from first island to second
🔥 **This is what your code is doing (and it’s optimal)**

---

### 🔹 Approach 2: Full Grid BFS (Level-by-level from all 1s)

* Start BFS from all land cells.
* Label each cell with which island it belongs to.
* Expand all islands until their paths meet.

❌ Slower and more complex to track boundaries.

---

### 🔹 Approach 3: Union-Find / DSU

* Mark connected components with DSU.
* Then calculate minimal Manhattan distance.

❌ Complicated, not necessary here.

## ✅ Why BFS over DFS for bridge-building?

| Type    | Used for                                                   |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DFS** | Marking the first island only                              |
| **BFS** | Finding shortest number of flips to reach second island 🔥 |

> ✅ Use **DFS** for region discovery
> ✅ Use **BFS** for **shortest path / distance** problems on grid

## ✅ Clean Python Code with Telugu Comments + Variable Names

```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def shortestBridge(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        total_rows = len(grid)
        total_cols = len(grid[0])
        directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]

        def dfs_mark_island(row: int, col: int):
            # First island ni mark cheyyadam with value 2
            grid[row][col] = 2
            boundary.append((row, col))

            for dr, dc in directions:
                new_row, new_col = row + dr, col + dc
                if 0 <= new_row < total_rows and 0 <= new_col < total_cols and grid[new_row][new_col] == 1:
                    dfs_mark_island(new_row, new_col)

        # 🧭 Step 1: Find and mark the first island
        boundary = []
        found = False
        for r in range(total_rows):
            if found:
                break
            for c in range(total_cols):
                if grid[r][c] == 1:
                    dfs_mark_island(r, c)
                    found = True
                    break

        # 🧱 Step 2: Use BFS to expand outward and find second island
        distance = 0
        bfs_queue = deque(boundary)

        while bfs_queue:
            for _ in range(len(bfs_queue)):
                row, col = bfs_queue.popleft()
                for dr, dc in directions:
                    new_row, new_col = row + dr, col + dc
                    if 0 <= new_row < total_rows and 0 <= new_col < total_cols:
                        if grid[new_row][new_col] == 1:
                            return distance  # Second island reached
                        elif grid[new_row][new_col] == 0:
                            grid[new_row][new_col] = -1  # Visited water
                            bfs_queue.append((new_row, new_col))
            distance += 1

        return -1
```

## ✅ Time & Space Complexity

| Metric              | Value   | Why?                             |
| ------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------- |
| 🕒 Time Complexity  | `O(N²)` | Visit each cell at most once     |
| 🧠 Space Complexity | `O(N²)` | Queue + recursive DFS call stack |

---

## ✅ Dry Run

### Input:

```python
grid = [
  [0, 1, 0],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 1]
]
```

### Steps:

* First island = (0,1)
* Mark as `2`
* BFS expands layer by layer:

  * First: (0,1)
  * Then: (1,1), (0,2), (0,0)
  * Eventually reaches (2,2)

→ **Flips required = 2**

## ✅ Edge Cases

| Case                      | Result                                       |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Islands touching          | 0 flips                                      |
| All water                 | Invalid (by constraint, must have 2 islands) |
| Very large grid (100x100) | Still `O(N²)` — efficient                    |

## ✅ How to Present in Meta Interview

> "I first use DFS to identify and mark all cells of the first island. Then, I use BFS from those marked cells to expand outward until I reach the second island. Each BFS layer represents one level of flip, so the first time we hit land again gives us the shortest path. DFS is good for connected component discovery; BFS guarantees the shortest bridge."
