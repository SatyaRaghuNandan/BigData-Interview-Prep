Absolutely! Let’s **re-explain clearly** the difference between:

> `right = array.length` vs. `right = array.length - 1`
> and how it affects binary search logic like in `pickIndex()` vs `findPeakElement()`.

---

## ✅ You Noticed:

### `pickIndex()`:

```java
int low = 0;
int high = prefix.length;  // 👈 array.length
```

### `findPeakElement()`:

```java
int left = 0;
int right = nums.length - 1;  // 👈 array.length - 1
```

---

## 🤔 Why the Difference?

This depends on:

* **What you're searching for**
* **Whether you're accessing `mid + 1`**
* **Whether your range is \[inclusive, inclusive] or \[inclusive, exclusive)**

---

### ✅ Case 1: `pickIndex()` — \[0, n) Range (Exclusive Upper Bound)

```java
int low = 0;
int high = prefix.length;
while (low < high) {
    int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
    if (target > prefix[mid]) {
        low = mid + 1;
    } else {
        high = mid;
    }
}
return low;
```

#### 🔍 Goal:

> Find the **smallest index `i` such that `prefix[i] > target`**
> This is known as a **lower bound search**

#### ✅ Why `high = prefix.length`?

* We never access `prefix[mid + 1]`, so we can go all the way up to `prefix.length`
* The search space is **\[0, n)** — left-inclusive, right-exclusive
* Using `low < high` ensures that when `low == high`, the loop stops, and `low` is the correct index

#### ✅ Safe because:

* We only access `prefix[mid]`
* `mid` will never be equal to `prefix.length`

---

### ✅ Case 2: `findPeakElement()` — \[0, n - 1] Range (Inclusive)

```java
int left = 0;
int right = nums.length - 1;
while (left < right) {
    int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
    if (nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]) {
        left = mid + 1;
    } else {
        right = mid;
    }
}
return left;
```

#### 🔍 Goal:

> Find **any peak** (where `nums[i] > nums[i ± 1]`)

#### ⚠️ Why `right = nums.length - 1`?

* Because we access `nums[mid + 1]`
* If `mid == nums.length - 1`, then `nums[mid + 1]` would go **out of bounds**
* So we must ensure that `mid + 1` is always valid

#### ✅ Using `right = nums.length - 1`:

* Ensures `mid` goes only up to `n - 2`
* That means `mid + 1` is always within array bounds

## 🧠 Rule of Thumb

| When You...                   | Use...                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Only use `mid`, no `mid + 1`  | `right = array.length`, `low < high` (exclusive range)     |
| Access `mid + 1` or `mid - 1` | `right = array.length - 1`, `left < right` (inclusive)     |
| Do exact target search        | `left <= right` + `right = array.length - 1` (standard BS) |
| Want lower/upper bound index  | `left < right`, return `left` at end (boundary search)     |

---

## ✅ TL;DR (Interview-Ready)

> In `pickIndex()`, we search over a virtual range \[0, total) using prefix sums, and never access `mid + 1`, so we use `right = prefix.length`.
> But in `findPeakElement()`, we access `nums[mid + 1]`, so we must limit `mid` to `n - 2`, which means `right = nums.length - 1`.
> The key is to avoid accessing out-of-bound indexes and to match the search space (`[left, right)` vs `[left, right]`) with your loop condition (`<` vs `<=`).
