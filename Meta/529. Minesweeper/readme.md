Absolutely! Let's go through **multiple approaches** to solve **Leetcode 529 ‚Äì Minesweeper**, followed by the **best solution** with proper code structure, meaningful variable names, and detailed **Telugu comments**.

---

## ‚úÖ Problem Recap

You are given a Minesweeper board and a click position. Based on the click:

* If it's a mine `'M'`, mark as `'X'` (game over).
* If it's an empty cell `'E'`:

  * Count adjacent mines.
  * If adjacent mines exist, replace `'E'` with that number (e.g., `'1'`, `'2'`, etc.)
  * If no adjacent mines, reveal cell as `'B'` and recursively reveal its neighbors.

---

## ‚úÖ Multiple Approaches

### ‚úÖ Approach 1: Recursive DFS (Depth-First Search)

* Recursive expansion of `'E'` cells until you reach boundaries or mine-adjacent cells.
* Elegant and easy to implement.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk of stack overflow on large boards.

üëâ This is what you already implemented.

---

### ‚úÖ Approach 2: Iterative BFS (Breadth-First Search)

* Use a queue (`deque`) instead of recursion.
* Reveal cells level by level.
* Safer for large grids (no recursion depth issue).
* More interview-preferred at Meta for scalability and testability.

---

### ‚ùå Approach 3: Full Board Scan on Click

* On each click, scan the whole board to update.
* Inefficient and not required for this problem.
* ‚ùå Not optimal or recommended.

---

## ‚úÖ Best Approach: **Iterative BFS**

(More scalable, safe against recursion stack overflow, and predictable)

---

## ‚úÖ Python Code (BFS) with Telugu Comments + Clean Variables

```python
from collections import deque
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def updateBoard(self, board: List[List[str]], click: List[int]) -> List[List[str]]:
        totalRows, totalCols = len(board), len(board[0])
        clickRow, clickCol = click

        # üî¥ User click chesina place lo mine unte, adi game over
        if board[clickRow][clickCol] == 'M':
            board[clickRow][clickCol] = 'X'
            return board

        # üü¢ Safe click aithe BFS use chesi reveal cheyyali
        directions = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1),
                      (0, -1),           (0, 1),
                      (1, -1),  (1, 0),  (1, 1)]

        queue = deque()
        queue.append((clickRow, clickCol))

        while queue:
            currentRow, currentCol = queue.popleft()

            # üõë If already visited or not 'E', skip cheyyali
            if board[currentRow][currentCol] != 'E':
                continue

            # üîç Neighbors lo mines count cheyyadam
            adjacentMineCount = 0
            neighbors = []

            for rowOffset, colOffset in directions:
                neighborRow = currentRow + rowOffset
                neighborCol = currentCol + colOffset

                if 0 <= neighborRow < totalRows and 0 <= neighborCol < totalCols:
                    if board[neighborRow][neighborCol] == 'M':
                        adjacentMineCount += 1
                    elif board[neighborRow][neighborCol] == 'E':
                        neighbors.append((neighborRow, neighborCol))

            # üî¢ If adjacent mines exist, cell ni '1'-'8' ga update cheyyali
            if adjacentMineCount > 0:
                board[currentRow][currentCol] = str(adjacentMineCount)
            else:
                # üü¶ No adjacent mines ‚Üí mark as 'B' and continue expansion
                board[currentRow][currentCol] = 'B'
                for neighbor in neighbors:
                    queue.append(neighbor)

        return board
```

## ‚úÖ Time and Space Complexity

| Metric              | Complexity | Explanation                                   |
| ------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| üïí Time Complexity  | `O(R √ó C)` | Each cell visited once                        |
| üß† Space Complexity | `O(R √ó C)` | BFS queue in worst case, all cells go into it |

Where:

* `R = total rows`
* `C = total columns`

---

## ‚úÖ Dry Run Example

### Input:

```python
board = [
 ['E', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'E'],
 ['E', 'E', 'M', 'E', 'E'],
 ['E', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'E'],
 ['E', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'E']
]
click = [3, 0]
```

### Step-by-step:

* `(3, 0)` is `'E'` ‚Üí no adjacent mines
* Mark as `'B'`, enqueue neighbors
* BFS continues expanding `'E'` cells
* Cells near the `'M'` (like `(1,2)`) will be marked as `'1'`, `'2'`, etc.

---

## ‚úÖ Test Cases to Validate

### Case 1: Mine Clicked

```python
board = [['M']]
click = [0, 0]
# Output: [['X']]
```

### Case 2: No Adjacent Mines

```python
click = [3, 0]
# Triggers BFS expansion, many cells become 'B'
```

### Case 3: Adjacent to 1 Mine

```python
click = [1, 1]
# Output: Cell shows '1' or '2' etc.
```

Absolutely! Since you're preparing for **Meta interviews**, here is the revised version of your **Minesweeper solution (LeetCode 529)** with:

‚úÖ Clean structure
‚úÖ Meaningful variable names
‚úÖ Meta-quality formatting
‚úÖ Telugu comments
‚úÖ Time & space complexity analysis

---

## ‚úÖ Problem Recap ‚Äì Plain English

You are given a board of characters:

* `'E'` ‚Äì Unrevealed Empty
* `'M'` ‚Äì Mine
* `'B'` ‚Äì Blank (no adjacent mines)
* `'1'`-`'8'` ‚Äì Number of adjacent mines
* `'X'` ‚Äì Mine that was clicked

When a cell is clicked:

* If it‚Äôs a mine (`'M'`), mark it `'X'`
* Else, recursively reveal cells:

  * Show number if adjacent to mine
  * Show `'B'` and reveal neighbors if no adjacent mines

---

## ‚úÖ Python Code with Clean Style and Telugu Comments

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def updateBoard(self, board: List[List[str]], click: List[int]) -> List[List[str]]:
        rowIndex, colIndex = click

        # üß® Click chesina cell 'M' unte ‚Äî mine kabatti game over, mark it as 'X'
        if board[rowIndex][colIndex] == 'M':
            board[rowIndex][colIndex] = 'X'
            return board

        # üîÑ Click chesina cell safe aithe, DFS/BFS tho reveal cheyyali
        self.revealCells(board, rowIndex, colIndex)
        return board

    def revealCells(self, board: List[List[str]], row: int, col: int) -> None:
        totalRows, totalCols = len(board), len(board[0])

        # ‚ùå Boundary or already revealed cell unte skip cheyyali
        if row < 0 or col < 0 or row >= totalRows or col >= totalCols:
            return
        if board[row][col] != 'E':
            return

        # üîç 8 directions lo mine count chudali
        directions = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1),
                      (0, -1),           (0, 1),
                      (1, -1),  (1, 0),  (1, 1)]

        mineCount = 0
        for dRow, dCol in directions:
            nextRow, nextCol = row + dRow, col + dCol
            if 0 <= nextRow < totalRows and 0 <= nextCol < totalCols:
                if board[nextRow][nextCol] == 'M':
                    mineCount += 1

        # üî¢ Adjacent mines unte count ni string ga petti return avvali
        if mineCount > 0:
            board[row][col] = str(mineCount)
            return

        # üü¶ No adjacent mines ‚Üí mark as 'B' and expand to neighbors
        board[row][col] = 'B'
        for dRow, dCol in directions:
            self.revealCells(board, row + dRow, col + dCol)
```

---

## üß† Time & Space Complexity

| Metric    | Value      | Notes                                          |
| --------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Time**  | `O(R √ó C)` | Worst-case visit all cells once                |
| **Space** | `O(R √ó C)` | Recursion stack in worst case (no memo needed) |

Where `R = number of rows`, `C = number of columns`.

---

## ‚úÖ Dry Run Example

```python
board = [
 ['E', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'E'],
 ['E', 'E', 'M', 'E', 'E'],
 ['E', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'E'],
 ['E', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'E']
]
click = [3, 0]
```

* `(3,0)` is `'E'` and has **no adjacent mines**
* So it's marked `'B'` and all neighbors are revealed
* This continues until all safe `'E'` cells are revealed or blocked by numbers/mine border

---

## ‚úÖ Test Scenarios

### 1. Clicking on a mine

```python
board = [['M']]
click = [0, 0]
‚Üí Output: [['X']]
```

### 2. Empty grid corner click

```python
click = [3, 0]
‚Üí Triggers full blank area expansion
```

### 3. Only one empty cell

```python
board = [['E']]
click = [0, 0]
‚Üí Output: [['B']]
```
