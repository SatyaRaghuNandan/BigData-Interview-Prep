Here’s a breakdown of what this `Solution_227_Variant` does and its clean **Python equivalent**.

---

## ✅ Problem Statement

Given a string `s` containing **non-negative integers** and **operators `+` and `*` only**, evaluate the **expression**.

> ⚠️ No parentheses, no subtraction or division. Only `+` and `*`.

---

## 🔍 C++ Explanation (Line-by-line)

```cpp
int curr_num = 0;      // Parse current number being built (multi-digit)
int prev_num = 0;      // Last number before operator is applied
int result = 0;        // Final cumulative result
char op = '+';         // Previous operator seen (initialized to '+')
```

### Main Loop:

```cpp
if (std::isdigit(s[i]))
    curr_num = curr_num * 10 + (s[i] - '0'); // Build number like 23, 245, etc.

if ((!std::isdigit(s[i]) && s[i] != ' ') || i == s.size() - 1)
```

* If we hit an operator or the last character, we apply the **previous operator** to `prev_num` and `curr_num`.

### Only `+` and `*` Handling:

```cpp
if (op == '+') {
    result += prev_num;
    prev_num = curr_num;
} else if (op == '*') {
    prev_num = prev_num * curr_num;
}
```

---

## ✅ Final Step

At the end of the loop, we still have one last `prev_num` left → add it to result.

---

## ✅ Python Version

```python
class Solution:
    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:
        curr_num = 0
        prev_num = 0
        result = 0
        op = '+'

        for i, ch in enumerate(s):
            if ch.isdigit():
                curr_num = curr_num * 10 + int(ch)

            # If ch is an operator or last char
            if (not ch.isdigit() and ch != ' ') or i == len(s) - 1:
                if op == '+':
                    result += prev_num
                    prev_num = curr_num
                elif op == '*':
                    prev_num *= curr_num

                curr_num = 0
                op = ch

        result += prev_num
        return result
```

---

## 🧪 Test Example:

```python
sol = Solution()
print(sol.calculate("3+2*2"))     # Output: 7
print(sol.calculate("4*5+3"))     # Output: 23
print(sol.calculate("10+2*3"))    # Output: 16
```












You're absolutely right — this `Solution_227_Variant` is a **simplified variant of Leetcode 227 (Basic Calculator II)**. Let's dive deep into:

---

## ✅ 1. Time and Space Complexity

| Metric                  | Value                                           |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| ⏱️ **Time Complexity**  | `O(N)` — one pass over the string               |
| 🧠 **Space Complexity** | `O(1)` — no stack, only constant variables used |

---

## ✅ 2. What Makes This a **Variant**?

This is a **constrained version** of the original problem. Here's a breakdown:

| Feature                   | **Original Problem (Leetcode 227)** | **This Variant (`+` and `*` only)** |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Supported Operators       | `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`                  | `+`, `*` only                       |
| Operator Precedence       | `*` and `/` > `+` and `-`           | Only `*` > `+`                      |
| Division                  | Yes (integer division)              | ❌ Not allowed                       |
| Negative Numbers          | Yes (via `-`)                       | ❌ Not handled                       |
| Parentheses               | ❌ Not supported in both             | ❌                                   |
| Number of State Variables | 3: `curr_num`, `prev_num`, `result` | ✅ Same                              |
| Use of Stack              | ❌ Not required in both              | ✅ Not needed                        |
| Edge Case Handling        | More complex due to `-`, `/`        | Simpler                             |

---

## ✅ 3. Key Logic Difference

### Original (Full Operators):

```python
if op == '+':
    result += prev_num
    prev_num = curr_num
elif op == '-':
    result += prev_num
    prev_num = -curr_num
elif op == '*':
    prev_num *= curr_num
elif op == '/':
    prev_num = int(prev_num / curr_num)
```

### ✅ Variant (Only + and \*):

```python
if op == '+':
    result += prev_num
    prev_num = curr_num
elif op == '*':
    prev_num *= curr_num
```

🔁 So:

* **Subtraction and division logic is eliminated**
* **No need to handle integer division flooring**
* **No negative number handling** (makes code lighter)

---

## ✅ 4. Telugu-style Explanation

```python
# ➕ '+' vachesinappudu: previous number ni result lo add cheyyadam, new number ni prev_num ki set cheyyadam
# ✖ '*' vachesinappudu: prev_num * curr_num cheyyadam (ante multiply ni defer cheyyadam until next operator)

# ➥ Last lo: result += prev_num — final result assemble cheyyadam
```

---

## ✅ 5. Interview Scenario: What to Say

> “This is a simplified version of the classic calculator problem. Since only `+` and `*` are supported, we don’t need to worry about operator precedence between `+`, `-`, `/`. We defer evaluation using a `prev_num` and apply multiplication immediately while addition is staged through the result.”

## ✅ Summary

| Feature                | `Solution_227` (Full) | `Solution_227_Variant` |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Handles `-`, `/`       | ✅ Yes                 | ❌ No                   |
| Integer division logic | ✅ Required            | ❌ Not required         |
| Precedence management  | ✅ More complex        | ✅ Simpler (`* > +`)    |
| Stack                  | ❌ Not used            | ❌ Not used             |
| Code complexity        | Moderate              | Simple & clean         |
| Ideal for Interviews   | Yes (if limited ops)  | ✅ Great for warmup     |
