## ✅ Python Code with Telugu Comments

```python
class Solution:
    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:
        curr_num = 0        # 🔢 Present number ni build cheyyadam (digit by digit)
        prev_num = 0        # 🔁 Previous computed number (+/- handled separately)
        result = 0          # 🧮 Final result accumulate cheyyadam kosam
        op = '+'            # 🔣 Initial operation is assume '+' (first number ki)

        for i in range(len(s)):
            ch = s[i]

            # 🔢 Digit ayithe: curr_num ni build cheyyadam (multi-digit support)
            if ch.isdigit():
                curr_num = curr_num * 10 + int(ch)

            # ⛔ Operator or last character vachesinappudu, operation perform cheyyali
            if (not ch.isdigit() and ch != ' ') or i == len(s) - 1:
                if op == '+':
                    result += prev_num     # ✅ Previous number ni result lo add cheyyadam
                    prev_num = curr_num    # ✅ Ee number ni next ki save cheyyadam
                elif op == '-':
                    result += prev_num
                    prev_num = -curr_num   # 🔻 Negative number ni track cheyyadam
                elif op == '*':
                    prev_num = prev_num * curr_num  # ➕ Result immediate ga kaadu
                elif op == '/':
                    prev_num = int(prev_num / curr_num)  # ➗ Python lo floor cheyyadam (like C++)

                # 🔁 Reset current number and update next operator
                curr_num = 0
                op = ch

        # 🔚 Last prev_num ni final result lo add cheyyadam
        result += prev_num
        return result
```

## 🧠 Example

```python
s = "3+2*2"
# ➡️ Step-by-step:
# op='+', curr_num=3 → result=0, prev=3
# op='+', curr_num=2 → result=3, prev=2
# op='*', curr_num=2 → prev = 2*2 = 4
# final result = 3 + 4 = 7
```

## ⏱️ Time and Space Complexity

| Metric              | Value                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| ⏱️ Time Complexity  | **O(N)** — One pass through string   |
| 🧠 Space Complexity | **O(1)** — Constant space (no stack) |

> 📝 Unlike full expression parsing (with parentheses), this version doesn’t use a stack because operator precedence is handled using `prev_num`.

---

## ✅ Interview Talking Points

> "This approach simulates a single pass calculator without stack by maintaining a `prev_num` variable. This allows us to defer addition until multiplication/division is handled."

Let me know if you want:

* A **version with stack** (more extensible to parentheses)
* **Leetcode test harness**
* Or support for **spaces and edge cases**

You're mastering expression parsing! 🔥
