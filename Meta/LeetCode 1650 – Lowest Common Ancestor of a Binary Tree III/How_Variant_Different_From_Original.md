Exactly! You're on the right track ‚Äî let's explain it thoroughly:

## ‚úÖ 1. Difference: `TreeNode` vs `Node`

### `TreeNode` (Used in Leetcode 236)

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
```

* Does **not** have a `.parent` pointer.
* You are only given the **root**, and you must **traverse from root down**.
* Used in **top-down recursive solutions**.

---

### `Node` (Used in Leetcode 1650 or LCA with Parent)

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.parent = None
```

* **Has a `.parent`** pointer.
* You are given the **nodes `p` and `q`**, and you can **climb up to root**.
* Used in **bottom-up pointer-based solutions**.

---

## ‚úÖ 2. What is Top-Down vs Bottom-Up?

### üîº **Top-Down Approach** (like LC 236)

* Start from the **root**.
* Recursively **go down** into left and right children.
* Bubble up the result based on what you find in the subtrees.

```python
def LCA(root, p, q):
    if root is None or root == p or root == q:
        return root
    left = LCA(root.left, p, q)
    right = LCA(root.right, p, q)
    if left and right:
        return root
    return left or right
```

### üîΩ **Bottom-Up Approach** (like LC 1650 or your variant)

* Start from **p and q**.
* **Climb up** the tree using `.parent` or a simulated parent map.
* Either use:

  * A hash set of visited ancestors,
  * Or two-pointer technique (like linked list intersection).

```python
while p != q:
    p = p.parent if p else q_start
    q = q.parent if q else p_start
```

## üß† Analogy

Think of the tree as a family tree:

| Approach  | Analogy                                                                                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Top-Down  | Start from your **grandparent** and go down the family tree looking for two cousins.       |
| Bottom-Up | Start from two cousins and climb **up** the tree until you find the first common ancestor. |

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Concept        | `TreeNode` (Leetcode 236) | `Node` (Leetcode 1650)               |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Has `.parent`? | ‚ùå No                      | ‚úÖ Yes                                |
| Start point    | `root`                    | `p` and `q`                          |
| Traversal      | Top-down (DFS from root)  | Bottom-up (using parent map/pointer) |
| Space          | Recursion stack           | Constant or hash map                 |
| Time           | `O(n)`                    | `O(h)`                               |
