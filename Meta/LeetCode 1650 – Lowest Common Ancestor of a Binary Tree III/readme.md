Excellent question! Both of these solutions are for the **LCA in a tree with parent pointers**, but they use **very different techniques**. Let’s go through them carefully:

## ✅ **Solution 1: Hash Set of Ancestors**

```python
def lowestCommonAncestor(self, p: 'Node', q: 'Node') -> 'Node':
    visited = set()
    while q:
        visited.add(q.val)
        q = q.parent
    
    while p:
        if p.val in visited:
            return p
        visited.add(p.val)
        p = p.parent
    return None
```

### 🔍 How it works:

1. Traverse up from `q` and **store all ancestors (values)** in a `set`.
2. Traverse up from `p`, and **check if any of its ancestors exist in the set**.
3. Return the first match — that’s the **lowest common ancestor**.

### ✅ Pros:

* Simple to understand.
* Easy to implement.

### ⚠️ Cons:

* Uses `.val` instead of the node reference — **fails if values are not unique!**
* Uses **O(h)** space for the set.

## ✅ **Solution 2: Two Pointer Trick (Like Linked List Cycle Intersection)**

```python
def lowestCommonAncestor(self, p: 'Node', q: 'Node') -> 'Node':
    p1, p2 = p, q
    while p1 != p2:
        p1 = p1.parent if p1 else q
        p2 = p2.parent if p2 else p
    return p1
```

### 🔍 How it works:

* Move `p1` and `p2` up one step at a time.
* When one pointer reaches the root, **switch it to the other node**.
* After at most 2 traversals (equalized distance), both pointers **meet at LCA**.

> This is exactly like **finding the intersection node of two linked lists**.

### ✅ Pros:

* **No extra space** (`O(1)` space).
* Works perfectly even if values are not unique.
* Elegant and clever — often impresses interviewers.

### ⚠️ Cons:

* Slightly less intuitive to explain if you're unfamiliar with the technique.

## 🧠 Key Differences

| Feature                      | **Solution 1 (Set Lookup)** | **Solution 2 (Two Pointer)**     |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Uses extra space?            | ✅ Yes – `O(h)` set          | ❌ No – constant space `O(1)`     |
| Requires unique node values? | ⚠️ Yes – uses `val` in set  | ✅ No – uses actual node refs     |
| Intuitive for beginners?     | ✅ Easier to follow          | ⚠️ Needs analogy to linked lists |
| Handles any tree structure?  | ✅ Yes, with unique values   | ✅ Yes                            |
| Time Complexity              | `O(h)`                      | `O(h)`                           |
| Space Complexity             | `O(h)`                      | `O(1)`                           |

## ✅ Recommendation

Use **Solution 2 (Two Pointer)** if:

* Node values are not unique.
* You want an elegant, optimal solution.
* You’re confident explaining pointer tricks.

Use **Solution 1** if:

* Node values are guaranteed to be unique.
* You want a quick, understandable solution.
