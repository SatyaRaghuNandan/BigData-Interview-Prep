You’ve implemented the **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)** algorithm for a **binary tree with parent pointers** — as in **LeetCode 1650 – Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree III**.

Below is a full **Python version with Telugu comments**, followed by an **explanation of the approach** and **time/space complexity**.

## ✅ Python Version with Telugu Comments

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val: int, parent: 'Node' = None):
        self.val = val
        self.parent = parent
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def lowestCommonAncestor(p_start: 'Node', q_start: 'Node') -> 'Node':
    # 👉 Two pointers use chestunnam (p and q)
    p = p_start
    q = q_start

    # 🔁 Loop until both pointers meet
    while p != q:
        # 🧭 p ni climb chesthu root daka veltham
        p = p.parent if p.parent else q_start

        # 🧭 q ni climb chesthu root daka veltham
        q = q.parent if q.parent else p_start

    # ☑️ Common node ekkada padindho adi LCA
    return p
```

## 🧠 How It Works (Two Pointer Technique)

This is similar to the **intersection of two linked lists**:

* You climb up the tree from both nodes (`p` and `q`) using `.parent`.
* When one reaches `None`, it starts from the other node's start.
* Eventually, both pointers meet at the **lowest common ancestor**.

🔄 Total path walked by both = `depth(p) + depth(q)`
This ensures equal traversal length and guarantees convergence.

## ✅ Example Tree:

```
        3
       / \
      5   1
     /   / \
    6   0   8
```

If `p = 6`, `q = 8`, then:

* `p` path: 6 → 5 → 3
* `q` path: 8 → 1 → 3

Both will meet at `3`.

## ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

| Metric    | Value                                                             |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Time**  | `O(H)` where `H` is the height of the tree                        |
| **Space** | `O(1)` constant space, since no recursion or data structures used |

---

## 🧪 Edge Cases

* 🔁 If `p == q`, returns `p` immediately
* 🆓 Works without needing left/right pointers — only `.parent`

Let me know if you want:

* Python unit tests
* Explanation with a hand-drawn path trace
* A version with **binary trees without parent pointers** (recursive or path-based)

I'm happy to help with that next!
