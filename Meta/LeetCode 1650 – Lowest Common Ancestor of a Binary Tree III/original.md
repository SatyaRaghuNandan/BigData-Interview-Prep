You’ve implemented the **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)** algorithm for a **binary tree with parent pointers** — as in **LeetCode 1650 – Lowest Common Ancestor of a 
Binary Tree III**.


Here’s the complete Java solution for **Leetcode 1650 - Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree III**, which assumes that **each node has a `.parent` pointer**.

I'll provide:

1. ✅ **Java Iterative Solution** (Two Pointer Technique)
2. ✅ **Java Recursive Solution** (Using HashSet)
3. ✅ **Time and Space Complexity**
4. ✅ 📌 Edge Case Notes

## ✅ Java Node Class Definition

```java
class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node parent;
    public Node left;
    public Node right;

    public Node(int val) {
        this.val = val;
    }
}
```

---

## ✅ 1. Iterative Solution (Two Pointers, Like Linked List Intersection)

```java
public class LCAWithParent {

    public Node lowestCommonAncestor(Node p, Node q) {
        Node a = p;
        Node b = q;

        // 🪜 Two pointer climb upwards
        while (a != b) {
            a = (a.parent != null) ? a.parent : q;
            b = (b.parent != null) ? b.parent : p;
        }

        return a; // or b, since a == b
    }
}
```

### 🧠 Logic (Telugu in English)

* RendU nodes ki `parent` path climb chesthu potham.
* Oka pointer `null` ki vachinappudu, vere node nunchi start cheyyadam.
* Iddaru okesari same node mida padutaaru (guaranteed due to total equal path logic).

## ✅ 2. Recursive Solution (Using HashSet to Track Ancestors)

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class LCAWithParentRecursive {

    public Node lowestCommonAncestor(Node p, Node q) {
        Set<Node> visited = new HashSet<>();

        // 👉 Climb from p and mark all ancestors
        while (p != null) {
            visited.add(p);
            p = p.parent;
        }

        // 👉 Climb from q and return the first common ancestor
        while (q != null) {
            if (visited.contains(q)) {
                return q;
            }
            q = q.parent;
        }

        return null; // In case there's no LCA (disconnected trees)
    }
}
```

## ⏱️ Time and Space Complexity

| Metric | Iterative (Two Pointer) | Recursive (Using Set)      |
| ------ | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Time   | `O(H)`                  | `O(H)`                     |
| Space  | `O(1)`                  | `O(H)` for HashSet storage |
| Notes  | Best in practice        | Clear ancestor-path logic  |

Where `H` is the height of the tree (or max depth from node to root).

---

## 🧪 Edge Cases

1. ✅ `p == q` → Returns `p` directly.
2. ✅ One is ancestor of the other → Still returns LCA correctly.
3. ✅ Tree with only one node → Works without issues.
4. ❌ Disconnected trees → Recursive version returns `null`, iterative may loop forever unless guarded.

---

## 📌 Optional Enhancements

Would you like any of these next?

* ✅ Java unit tests using `JUnit` with edge cases
* ✅ Visualization of pointer paths
* ✅ Conversion to tree *without* parent pointer (DFS approach)

Let me know how you’d like to continue!



Below is a full **Python version with Telugu comments**, followed by an **explanation of the approach** and **time/space complexity**.

## ✅ Python Version with Telugu Comments

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val: int, parent: 'Node' = None):
        self.val = val
        self.parent = parent
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def lowestCommonAncestor(p_start: 'Node', q_start: 'Node') -> 'Node':
    # 👉 Two pointers use chestunnam (p and q)
    p = p_start
    q = q_start

    # 🔁 Loop until both pointers meet
    while p != q:
        # 🧭 p ni climb chesthu root daka veltham
        p = p.parent if p.parent else q_start

        # 🧭 q ni climb chesthu root daka veltham
        q = q.parent if q.parent else p_start

    # ☑️ Common node ekkada padindho adi LCA
    return p
```

## 🧠 How It Works (Two Pointer Technique)

This is similar to the **intersection of two linked lists**:

* You climb up the tree from both nodes (`p` and `q`) using `.parent`.
* When one reaches `None`, it starts from the other node's start.
* Eventually, both pointers meet at the **lowest common ancestor**.

🔄 Total path walked by both = `depth(p) + depth(q)`
This ensures equal traversal length and guarantees convergence.

## ✅ Example Tree:

```
        3
       / \
      5   1
     /   / \
    6   0   8
```

If `p = 6`, `q = 8`, then:

* `p` path: 6 → 5 → 3
* `q` path: 8 → 1 → 3

Both will meet at `3`.

## ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

| Metric    | Value                                                             |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Time**  | `O(H)` where `H` is the height of the tree                        |
| **Space** | `O(1)` constant space, since no recursion or data structures used |

---

## 🧪 Edge Cases

* 🔁 If `p == q`, returns `p` immediately
* 🆓 Works without needing left/right pointers — only `.parent`

---

Let me know if you want:

* Python unit tests
* Explanation with a hand-drawn path trace
* A version with **binary trees without parent pointers** (recursive or path-based)

I'm happy to help with that next!
