Excellent! This is a **variant** of LeetCode 133 where the graph might be **disconnected** (i.e., multiple connected components). You’ve introduced a custom `Graph` structure that maintains a list of root nodes (`input.roots`), allowing for disconnected components.

Let’s walk through this **step-by-step** with **detailed explanations**, Telugu comments (if translated to Python), and visual tracing.

---

## ✅ **Problem Variant: Clone Disconnected Graph**

### 🎯 Goal:

* Clone a graph that may have **multiple disconnected components**.
* Each component is reachable from one of the **`roots`** in the input graph.
* Return a cloned graph where all components are deep copied.

---

## 📦 Assumptions:

You're using:

```cpp
struct Node {
    int val;
    std::vector<Node*> neighbors;
};

struct Graph {
    std::vector<Node*> roots;  // each entry is a root of a component
};
```

---

## 🔁 High-Level Algorithm:

1. Iterate over all nodes in `input.roots`.
2. For each non-null root node, perform DFS to clone it.
3. Store the cloned root in `output.roots`.

---

## 🔄 DFS Function: `dfs_133_variant(...)`

```cpp
if (old_to_new.contains(node))
    return old_to_new[node];
```

🟢 **Cycle Check**: If node already cloned, return it (avoid infinite recursion).

```cpp
old_to_new[node] = new Node(node->val);
```

🛠️ **Clone the Node**: Create a new node with the same value.

```cpp
for (auto neighbor : node->neighbors)
    old_to_new[node]->neighbors.push_back(dfs_133_variant(neighbor, old_to_new));
```

🔁 **Recursive Cloning**: Clone each neighbor and attach to the cloned node.

## 🧪 Visual Trace for Disconnected Graph

Assume we have:

### Graph 1:

```
1 -- 2
```

### Graph 2:

```
3 -- 4 -- 5
```

### `input.roots = [1, 3]`

➡️ You’ll perform DFS **twice**:

### Clone Graph 1:

* Clone 1 → clone 2 → back to clone 1 (already visited)

### Clone Graph 2:

* Clone 3 → clone 4 → clone 5

---

## ✅ Final State of Output:

* `output.roots = [clone1, clone3]`
* Internally:

  * `clone1.neighbors = [clone2]`
  * `clone3.neighbors = [clone4]`
  * `clone4.neighbors = [clone3, clone5]`
  * `clone5.neighbors = [clone4]`

All connections and values are deeply copied.

---

## ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

### ✅ Time Complexity: `O(N + E)`

* `N` = total nodes across all components.
* `E` = total edges.
* Every node and edge visited once.

### ✅ Space Complexity: `O(N)`

* For `old_to_new` hashmap.
* Stack space for DFS recursion.

## 🧠 Python Equivalent with Telugu Comments

If this were in Python:


```java

import java.util.*;

// 🔷 Node definition
class Node {
    int val;
    List<Node> neighbors;

    Node(int val) {
        this.val = val;
        this.neighbors = new ArrayList<>();
    }
}

// 🔷 Graph definition (contains multiple roots – disconnected graph)
class Graph {
    List<Node> roots;

    Graph() {
        this.roots = new ArrayList<>();
    }
}

class Solution {
    // 🔁 Clone chesina node ni return cheyyadam, memoization tho
    private Node dfsClone(Node node, Map<Node, Node> oldToNew) {
        // 🟢 Already clone chesina node unte return cheyyadam (cycles kosam)
        if (oldToNew.containsKey(node)) {
            return oldToNew.get(node);
        }

        // 🔵 Kotha clone create cheyyadam
        Node clone = new Node(node.val);
        oldToNew.put(node, clone);

        // 🔁 Neighbors ni recursive ga clone cheyyadam
        for (Node neighbor : node.neighbors) {
            clone.neighbors.add(dfsClone(neighbor, oldToNew));
        }

        return clone;
    }

    // 🔷 Disconnected Graph Clone cheyyadam (multiple components)
    public Graph cloneDisconnectedGraph(Graph graph) {
        Graph output = new Graph();

        for (Node root : graph.roots) {
            if (root == null) continue;

            Map<Node, Node> oldToNew = new HashMap<>();
            Node clonedRoot = dfsClone(root, oldToNew);
            output.roots.add(clonedRoot);
        }

        return output;
    }
}





```

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.neighbors = []

class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.roots = []

def dfs_clone(node, old_to_new):
    # 🟢 Node already cloned aithe, direct ga return cheyyadam
    if node in old_to_new:
        return old_to_new[node]

    # 🔵 Clone create cheyyadam
    clone = Node(node.val)
    old_to_new[node] = clone

    # 🔁 Neighbors clone cheyyadam
    for neighbor in node.neighbors:
        clone.neighbors.append(dfs_clone(neighbor, old_to_new))

    return clone

def clone_disconnected_graph(graph):
    output = Graph()
    for root in graph.roots:
        if root is None:
            continue
        old_to_new = {}
        output.roots.append(dfs_clone(root, old_to_new))
    return output
```
