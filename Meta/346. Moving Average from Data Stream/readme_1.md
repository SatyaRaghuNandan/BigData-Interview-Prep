Great! Let’s break it down step by step so you clearly understand what this **`MovingAverage`** class is doing.

---

## ✅ **Problem: Moving Average from Data Stream**

You're asked to design a class to calculate the **moving average of the last `N` numbers**.

---

## 🎯 Example

Let's say size = 3 (you want a moving average of the last 3 numbers):

```java
MovingAverage m = new MovingAverage(3);

m.next(1);  // avg = 1.0         → only [1]
m.next(10); // avg = (1 + 10)/2  → [1, 10]
m.next(3);  // avg = (1+10+3)/3  → [1,10,3]
m.next(5);  // avg = (10+3+5)/3  → [10,3,5] → drops 1
```

---

## 🧠 What’s the Goal?

Maintain a **sliding window** of the last `size` elements, and return their average each time you insert a new value.

---

## 🔍 Let’s Understand the Java Code

### 🧱 Class Variables

```java
int size = 0;         // Max size of sliding window
int head = 0;         // Points to the most recent element
int windowSum = 0;    // Sum of elements in the window
int count = 0;        // Total elements seen
int[] queue;          // Circular buffer
```

---

### 👷 Constructor

```java
public MovingAverage(int size) {
    this.size = size;
    queue = new int[size];
}
```

* You're preallocating a **fixed-size array** to store the last `N` values.
* This is called a **circular buffer**.

---

### 📈 `next(int value)`

This is where the logic happens. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

```java
++count;
```

* Track how many numbers you've seen so far.

```java
int tail = (head + 1) % size;
```

* Find the index that will be **evicted** (oldest value).
* Since you're using a circular array, use modulo `% size`.

```java
windowSum = windowSum - queue[tail] + value;
```

* Subtract the value that’s getting evicted (oldest),
* Add the new value.

```java
head = (head + 1) % size;
```

* Move head to the next index where the new value goes.

```java
queue[head] = value;
```

* Save the new value into the queue.

```java
return (1.0 * windowSum) / Math.min(count, size);
```

* Return the average over the last `N` elements.
* If you’ve seen less than `size` elements, divide by `count`.

## 🔁 Dry Run

Let's dry run with `size = 3`:

```java
MovingAverage m = new MovingAverage(3);
m.next(1) => queue = [1, 0, 0], windowSum = 1, avg = 1.0
m.next(10) => queue = [1, 10, 0], windowSum = 11, avg = 5.5
m.next(3) => queue = [1, 10, 3], windowSum = 14, avg = 4.66
m.next(5) => evict 1 → queue = [5, 10, 3], windowSum = 18, avg = 6.0
```

---

## ✅ Summary in Plain English (5 Lines)

1. You maintain a fixed-size queue using an array and circular indexing.
2. Every new value replaces the oldest one in the array.
3. The sum is updated by removing the old value and adding the new one.
4. `head` keeps track of where to insert the new value.
5. You return the average of the last `N` inserted values.

If you'd like, I can rewrite this code using a **`Queue` or Deque\` version** which may be easier to understand. Let me know!
