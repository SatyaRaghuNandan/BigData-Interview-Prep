Perfect — here’s a slightly **expanded yet still concise** version of the iterative `myPow(x, n)` explanation that you can confidently say in a Meta interview:

### ✅ Iterative Exponentiation by Squaring — `myPow(x, n)`

---

### 🔧 Algorithm:

1. **Handle Negative Exponent:**

   * If `n < 0`, we convert the problem to its reciprocal form:

     ```python
     x = 1 / x
     n = abs(n)
     ```

2. **Initialize Variables:**

   * `result = 1.0` → stores the final accumulated power
   * `doubling_val = x` → used to keep squaring the base

3. **Process Each Bit of `n`:**

   * While `n != 0`:

     * If the **current least significant bit is 1** (i.e., `n % 2 == 1`), multiply the current `doubling_val` into `result`:

       ```python
       result *= doubling_val
       ```
     * Square `doubling_val` to prepare the next power:

       ```python
       doubling_val *= doubling_val
       ```
     * Right-shift the exponent by halving it:

       ```python
       n //= 2
       ```

4. **Return the Final Result:**

   * `return result`

### 📌 Summary for Interview:

> "I use **iterative exponentiation by squaring** to compute `x^n`. If `n` is negative, I invert the base and use the absolute exponent. I initialize `result = 1.0` and `doubling_val = x`. For each bit in the binary representation of `n`, I multiply `doubling_val` into `result` if the bit is set, then square `doubling_val` and halve `n`. This allows us to compute the power in **O(log n)** time and **O(1)** space."

### 🧠 Why it’s Efficient:

* Leverages the **binary representation** of the exponent.
* Avoids redundant multiplications.
* Works for large `n` without recursion or stack overflow.

Great — you're now using the **iterative version of Exponentiation by Squaring** for `x^n`, which improves the **space complexity from O(log n) → O(1)**. This is a common **follow-up question** in interviews after solving the recursive version.

```python
class Solution:
    def myPow(self, x: float, n: int) -> float:
        # n negative unte, reciprocal teesukovali: x^-n = 1 / x^n
        if n < 0:
            x = 1 / x       # x ni 1/x ga marchadam
            n = abs(n)      # n ni positive ga teesukovadam

        result = 1.0         # Final result accumulator
        doubling_val = x     # Squaring kosam base ni track cheyyadam

        while n != 0:
            # Odd power unte, current doubling_val ni result lo include cheyyali
            if n % 2 == 1:
                result *= doubling_val

            # doubling_val ni square cheyyali → x, x^2, x^4, x^8 ...
            doubling_val *= doubling_val

            # n ni half cheyyadam (binary power reduction)
            n //= 2

        return result
```

## 🧠 Telugu Explanation (Line-by-Line)

```text
1. n negative unte, x ni 1/x ga marchadam and n ni positive cheyyadam.
2. result = 1.0 → idi accumulator, final answer ikkadey build avtadi.
3. doubling_val = x → idi power doubling ki upayogistharu.
4. while loop: n ni binary ga process cheyyadam.

    - n odd unte result *= doubling_val → a bit is set, so include that power.
    - doubling_val *= doubling_val → base ni square cheyyadam (x^1 → x^2 → x^4 ...)
    - n //= 2 → next binary digit process cheyyadam.
```

## 🔁 Bonus Interview Follow-Ups:

1. **What if n is `Integer.MIN_VALUE` (`-2^31`)?**
   👉 Use `long` to avoid overflow when converting `n = -n`.

2. **What if x is 0 or negative?**
   👉 Edge cases: return 0 for `x=0, n>0`; throw for `x=0, n<=0`.

3. **What if fractional powers?**
   👉 Not supported with this logic (only works for integer powers).
