Excellent observation! The `+1` in the `end` block is **critical** and often the part that **confuses many candidates**. Let’s break it down **clearly** with **examples**, intuition, and **dry run**.

---

## 🔍 Let’s Revisit the Key Lines:

### ✅ Inside `"start"` log:

```java
result[stack.peek()] += timestamp - prev;
prev = timestamp;
```

* We are **pausing** the current function on top of the stack.
* So, we calculate: `current_time - prev` → time that current function ran **until now**.
* Then we **push the new function** onto the stack and **reset `prev = timestamp`**.

---

### ✅ Inside `"end"` log:

```java
result[stack.pop()] += timestamp - prev + 1;
prev = timestamp + 1;
```

* Why `+1`? Because the `end` **timestamp is inclusive**.
* It means the function is still **running during** this timestamp unit.

---

### ✅ 💡 Real-World Analogy:

Suppose a function starts at **t=2** and ends at **t=4**:

```
start: t=2
end:   t=4 → inclusive
```

So the function ran at:

```
t = 2, 3, 4 → 3 units of time
```

But `timestamp - prev = 4 - 2 = 2` → ❌ *Wrong time*

Hence we need:

```
4 - 2 + 1 = 3 ✅
```

That’s why we do `+1` to **count the end timestamp itself**.

## 🔂 Full Dry Run with Example:

### Input:

```java
n = 1
logs = [
  "0:start:2",
  "0:end:4"
]
```

### Step-by-step:

| Action    | Stack | `prev` | Explanation                       | result\[0] |
| --------- | ----- | ------ | --------------------------------- | ---------- |
| `start:2` | \[0]  | 2      | Nothing to add, just push         | 0          |
| `end:4`   | \[]   | 5      | Add `4 - 2 + 1 = 3` to result\[0] | 3          |

So final output: `result = [3]`

---

## ✅ In Short:

| Without `+1` | With `+1`       |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| 4 - 2 = 2 ❌  | 4 - 2 + 1 = 3 ✅ |

> The `+1` accounts for the fact that the end timestamp is **inclusive** — the function is still **running at that moment**.

Would you like me to simulate a **nested example** to see how this plays out with multiple functions?
