Absolutely! Let‚Äôs walk through the **Robot Room Cleaner problem (Leetcode 489)** the way you should explain it in an interview at Meta.

---

## ‚úÖ Problem Summary (Plain English)

You're given access to a **robot** that moves and cleans an unknown room.
You **don‚Äôt know** the grid/map or where obstacles are ‚Äî it‚Äôs a true **blind robot problem**.

The robot API lets you:

* `move()` ‚Üí Move forward if not blocked
* `turnLeft()` / `turnRight()` ‚Üí Rotate 90¬∞
* `clean()` ‚Üí Clean current cell

Your job is to write logic to:

* Make the robot clean all reachable cells from its starting point

---

## ‚úÖ Key Constraints

* Robot starts at `(0, 0)` ‚Äî assume it's the origin
* It can **only move forward** or rotate ‚Äî no direct (x, y) access
* You must **simulate coordinates** and **track visited cells manually**
* You must implement **backtracking** to explore and return

---

## ‚úÖ Multiple Approaches (Plain English)

---

### üîπ Approach 1: DFS with Backtracking (Recommended)

* Simulate coordinates using `(x, y)` and direction (`0=up`, `1=right`, `2=down`, `3=left`)
* For every cell:

  1. Clean it
  2. Try moving in all 4 directions
  3. If `move()` returns `True`, update `(x, y)` accordingly
  4. Recursively explore
  5. **Backtrack** using turn-turn-move-turn-turn

‚úÖ Works for all layouts
‚úÖ Clean + interview-preferred

---

### üîπ Approach 2: BFS with Direction Handling (Not Practical Here)

* Theoretically you can simulate a BFS
* But robot has **no global view** or map ‚Äî BFS needs full room graph
* ‚ùå Not recommended ‚Äî **DFS is the only viable approach**

---

## ‚úÖ Best Solution: DFS with Backtracking

Let‚Äôs rewrite your solution with:

* ‚úÖ Meaningful variable names
* ‚úÖ Telugu comments
* ‚úÖ Backtracking clearly defined
* ‚úÖ Meta-quality clean structure

## ‚úÖ Python Code (Clean + Commented)

```python
class Solution:
    def cleanRoom(self, robot):
        # ‚û§ Directions: Up, Right, Down, Left (clockwise)
        direction_vectors = [(-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1)]
        visited_positions = set()

        def go_back_to_previous_position():
            """
            üîÅ Robot ni previous position ki tippadam:

            """
            robot.turnLeft()
            robot.turnLeft()
            robot.move()
            robot.turnRight()
            robot.turnRight()

        def backtrack(current_x: int, current_y: int, facing_direction: int):
            """
            üß† DFS with backtracking:
            - current_x, current_y ‚Üí current position
            - facing_direction: 0=Up, 1=Right, 2=Down, 3=Left
            """
            visited_positions.add((current_x, current_y))
            robot.clean()

            for i in range(4):
                # ‚û§ Compute next direction and position
                new_direction = (facing_direction + i) % 4
                move_x, move_y = direction_vectors[new_direction]
                next_x = current_x + move_x
                next_y = current_y + move_y

                if (next_x, next_y) not in visited_positions:
                    if robot.move():
                        backtrack(next_x, next_y, new_direction)
                        go_back_to_previous_position()

                # üîÅ Turn right to try next direction
                robot.turnRight()

        # Start DFS from the origin (0, 0), facing "up" (direction = 0)
        backtrack(0, 0, 0)
```

## ‚úÖ Time and Space Complexity

| Metric   | Value  | Explanation                                              |
| -------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| üïí Time  | `O(N)` | Each cell visited and cleaned once (N = reachable cells) |
| üß† Space | `O(N)` | Stack depth for DFS + visited set                        |

‚úÖ Efficient even for large open rooms ‚Äî robot only explores **reachable** space.

---

## ‚úÖ Dry Run Example

### Room (Conceptually ‚Äî not given directly):

```
+---+---+---+
|   | # |   |
+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |
+---+---+---+
```

* Robot starts at `(0, 0)`
* Explores up, right, down, left
* Encounters wall (`#`) ‚Üí doesn't move in that direction
* Visits each accessible cell once and backtracks when needed

## ‚úÖ Edge Cases to Discuss

| Scenario                        | Outcome                             |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Surrounded by walls             | Robot cleans only 1 cell (itself)   |
| Long corridor                   | Robot goes forward, then backtracks |
| Open grid with holes            | Robot avoids obstacles correctly    |
| No cleaning required (all done) | Still visits, doesn‚Äôt re-clean      |

---

## ‚úÖ Interview Talking Points

> ‚ÄúI used a recursive DFS with backtracking because the robot has no map. We simulate its movement using directions and (x, y) coordinates. To prevent infinite loops, we maintain a `visited` set. After moving forward, we backtrack by reversing direction and reorienting the robot. This is optimal because each cell is visited once, and the robot doesn‚Äôt explore blocked paths.‚Äù
