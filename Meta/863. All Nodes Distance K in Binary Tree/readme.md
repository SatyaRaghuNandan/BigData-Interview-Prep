No worries! Let’s break down the **"All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree"** problem clearly and step-by-step. This problem is very common in interviews, especially at companies like Meta, so it's worth understanding deeply.

---

## ✅ Problem Summary (Leetcode 863)

You're given:

* A **binary tree** (each node has a `val`, `left`, and `right`).
* A `target` node inside that tree.
* An integer `k`.

👉 Your goal:

> Return **all nodes that are exactly `k` edges away** from the `target` node.

### 🔍 Example

```
      3
     / \
    5   1
   /|   |\
  6 2   0 8
    |
   7 4

target = 5, k = 2
```

Nodes **2 steps away** from `5` are:

* `7` → 5 → 2 → 7
* `4` → 5 → 2 → 4
* `1` → 5 → 3 → 1

✅ **Answer: \[7, 4, 1]**

## 🧠 Intuition

Binary Trees only go **down** (left/right), so if you want to move **upward** (towards parent), you must convert the tree into an **undirected graph**.

So:

1. Convert tree → graph: treat each node like a graph node that connects to parent and children.
2. Run **BFS** (Breadth First Search) starting from the `target`, stop when you reach distance `k`.

## 🧱 Breakdown of the Java Code

```java
Map<Integer, List<Integer>> graph = new HashMap<>();
dfsBuild(root, null, graph);
```

✔️ Step 1: Convert Tree to Graph using DFS

* Every edge between `parent` and `child` becomes bidirectional.
* Graph: `node -> list of neighbors (children + parent)`

```java
queue.add(new int[] { target.val, 0 });
```

✔️ Step 2: Start BFS from target node, distance = 0

```java
while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
    int[] cur = queue.poll();
    int node = cur[0], distance = cur[1];
    
    if (distance == k) {
        answer.add(node); // found node at distance k
        continue;
    }

    for (int neighbor : graph.getOrDefault(node, new ArrayList<>())) {
        if (!visited.contains(neighbor)) {
            visited.add(neighbor);
            queue.add(new int[] { neighbor, distance + 1 });
        }
    }
}
```

✔️ Step 3: BFS → Traverse each level (like level order)

* At each step, increase distance.
* When distance == `k`, collect the node values.

## 🛠️ dfsBuild – Convert Tree to Graph

```java
private void dfsBuild(TreeNode cur, TreeNode parent, Map<Integer, List<Integer>> graph) {
    if (cur != null && parent != null) {
        graph.putIfAbsent(cur.val, new ArrayList<>());
        graph.putIfAbsent(parent.val, new ArrayList<>());
        graph.get(cur.val).add(parent.val);
        graph.get(parent.val).add(cur.val);
    }

    if (cur.left != null) dfsBuild(cur.left, cur, graph);
    if (cur.right != null) dfsBuild(cur.right, cur, graph);
}
```

🔁 This builds a bidirectional edge between:

* `cur <-> parent`
* Recursively applies for all left/right children

## 🔄 Time and Space Complexity

| Metric | Value                            |
| ------ | -------------------------------- |
| Time   | `O(N)` — build graph + BFS       |
| Space  | `O(N)` — graph + visited + queue |

`N` = number of nodes in the binary tree

---

## 📌 Key Insight

You are solving a **shortest path in unweighted graph** problem by:

* Turning a binary tree into a **graph**
* Running **BFS** from the `target` node until distance `k`

If you'd like, I can visualize the graph from an example or provide a Java version with Telugu-style comments. Would that help?
