## 🧠 Problem Summary

You’re given a string `s` containing just `'('` and `')'`.
Your goal is to **return the minimum number of parentheses to add** (either `'('` or `')'`) to make the string **valid**.

> A valid string means: every opening `'('` has a closing `')'` and vice versa — in the correct order.

## ✅ Step-by-Step Code Explanation

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumAddToMakeValid(self, s: str) -> int:
        extra_right = 0     # ✅ Tracks unmatched ')' characters
        left_open = 0       # ✅ Tracks open '(' that still need matching ')'

        for c in s:
            if c == '(':
                left_open += 1     # Open parenthesis → need one more ')'
            elif c == ')':
                if left_open == 0:
                    extra_right += 1  # No '(' to match → needs one '('
                else:
                    left_open -= 1    # Match found → use one open '('

        # Final answer = unclosed '(' + unmatched ')'
        return left_open + extra_right
```

## ✅ Dry Run

### Input:

```python
s = "()))(("
```

### Initial State:

```text
left_open = 0
extra_right = 0
```

### Walkthrough:

| Char | Action                    | left\_open | extra\_right |
| ---- | ------------------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| '('  | open found → need one ')' | 1          | 0            |
| ')'  | match with open           | 0          | 0            |
| ')'  | no open → needs one '('   | 0          | 1            |
| ')'  | no open → needs one '('   | 0          | 2            |
| '('  | open found                | 1          | 2            |
| '('  | open found                | 2          | 2            |

✅ Final state:

```text
left_open = 2    # 2 '(' need closing
extra_right = 2  # 2 ')' were unmatched earlier
```

### Output:

```python
return 2 + 2 = 4
```

## ✅ Time & Space Complexity (Line-by-Line)

| Line / Step            | Complexity  | Explanation                 |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------- |
| `extra_right = 0`      | `O(1)`      | Constant time init          |
| `left_open = 0`        | `O(1)`      | Constant time init          |
| `for c in s:`          | `O(N)`      | Iterate over all characters |
| Inside `if/elif` logic | `O(1)` each | Constant operations         |
| Final return statement | `O(1)`      | Just adding two integers    |

### ✅ Overall:

* **Time:** `O(N)` → N = length of string
* **Space:** `O(1)` → Only two counters (`left_open`, `extra_right`)

---

## ✅ Interview Explanation (Meta-style)

> “I use two counters: one for unclosed `'('` and one for unmatched `')'`. As I iterate through the string:

* When I see `'('`, I increment `left_open`
* When I see `')'`:

  * If there’s an unmatched `'('`, I pair it
  * Else, I increment `extra_right` since I need a new `'('` for balance
    At the end, the sum of both gives the number of insertions required to make the string valid.”

## ✅ Edge Cases

| Input     | Output | Reason        |
| --------- | ------ | ------------- |
| `""`      | `0`    | Already valid |
| `"((("`   | `3`    | Needs 3 `')'` |
| `")))"`   | `3`    | Needs 3 `'('` |
| `"()()"`  | `0`    | Already valid |
| `"(()))"` | `1`    | Needs 1 `'('` |
