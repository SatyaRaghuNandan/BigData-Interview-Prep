        last = float('-inf')
        ans = []

        while i < len(first) or j < len(second):

                ans.append([pick[0], min(last, pick[1])])
                
            last = max(last, pick[1])
            
        return ans
Solution3. Sweep line
Sweep line is a general technology to solve interval overlapping count/non-overlapping problems. The core of sweep line algorithm is "NOT to view an interval as a pair, rather it breaks each interval into 2 pairs [start_number, 0], [end_numer, 1], so the interval list grow from N to 2N. Then sort the 2N sized array and scan"

Below is is an sweep line scan over 2 already sorted intervals.

class Solution:
    def intervalIntersection(self, first: List[List[int]], second: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        cnt = i = j = 0
        ans = []
        pick = val = None
        
        while i < len(first) * 2 and j < len(second) * 2:
            if first[i // 2][i % 2] < second[j // 2][j % 2] or first[i // 2][i % 2] == second[j // 2][j % 2] and i % 2 == 0:
                pick = i
                val = first[i // 2][i % 2]
                i += 1
            else:
                pick = j
                val = second[j // 2][j % 2]
                j += 1
                
            prev = cnt
            
            cnt += 1 if pick % 2 == 0 else -1
            
            if cnt == 2 and prev == 1:
                ans.append([val, None])
            elif cnt == 1 and prev == 2 and ans:
                ans[-1][1] = val
                
        
        return ans
		
Here’s a detailed breakdown of the `intervalIntersection` problem using your preferred format:

---

### ✅ **Problem**:

Given two lists of closed intervals, `first` and `second`, return the intersection of these two interval lists.

---

### ✅ **Approach**:

The code uses a **sweep line algorithm**.
Each interval has two points: start and end. All starts increment a counter, all ends decrement it.

When the counter becomes 2, it means both intervals are overlapping ⇒ Start of intersection.
When it drops from 2 to 1 ⇒ End of intersection.

The two intervals are flattened into a virtual 1D stream using `i` and `j`, simulating a merge of events sorted by value.

    def intervalIntersection(self, first: List[List[int]], second: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        # Count of active intervals

        # Pointers for both lists
        i = j = 0  
        # Final answer

            if first[i // 2][i % 2] < second[j // 2][j % 2] or (first[i // 2][i % 2] == second[j // 2][j % 2] and i % 2 == 0):
                pick = i
                val = first[i // 2][i % 2]
                i += 1
            else:
                pick = j
                val = second[j // 2][j % 2]
                j += 1

            prev = cnt
            # Start point aithe cnt ++, end point aithe cnt --
            cnt += 1 if pick % 2 == 0 else -1

            # cnt 2 aithe overlap start avutondi

### 🧠 **Concept Recap**:

* **Interval Start = +1**, **End = -1**
* Maintain counter. `cnt == 2` ⇒ intersection starts.
* Use flat processing (`i % 2`) to simulate point-wise merging.
* Python `i // 2` gets interval index, `i % 2` gets 0 for start, 1 for end.

Would you now like the **variant** you mentioned (e.g., including open intervals, merging intervals, or 3+ lists intersection)? Let me know which one you want to explore.
-------------------------------------------------------------


Great — this is a **Meta-style variant** of the interval intersection problem:

---

### ✅ **Variant Problem**:

**You are given `K` lists of disjoint, sorted intervals.**
You need to find the intersection among all `K` lists — i.e., intervals that are common to *all* the lists.

---

### ✅ **Example Input:**

```python
intervals = [
    [[1, 5], [10, 14], [16, 18]],
    [[3, 7], [12, 15], [17, 20]],
    [[2, 6], [8, 11], [13, 17]]
]
```

### ✅ **Expected Output:**

```python
[[3, 5], [13, 14], [17, 17]]
```

---

### ✅ **Approach: Sweep Line for K Lists**

This is similar to the 2-list version, but generalized using a **min-heap** over all the interval start and end points.

Each interval contributes:

* `(start, +1)`  – start of coverage
* `(end, -1)`    – end of coverage

We sort all these points and **sweep** through them, increasing a counter.

When the counter hits `K`, it means **all K intervals are overlapping**, so we begin a new intersection. When the count drops below `K`, we end the intersection.

---

### ✅ **Python Code with Telugu Comments:**

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def intervalIntersectionKLists(self, intervals: List[List[List[int]]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        events = []

        # Prathi interval ni flatten chesi, start and end ni separate ga events list lo store cheyyali
        for lst in intervals:
            for start, end in lst:
                events.append((start, 1))  # Start event
                events.append((end, -1))   # End event

        # Sorting events: start point first, then end
        events.sort()

        ans = []
        cnt = 0
        start = None
        k = len(intervals)  # Total number of lists

        # Ee loop lo manam sweep chestham
        for time, typ in events:
            prev = cnt
            cnt += typ

            # Start of full overlap
            if cnt == k and typ == 1:
                start = time

            # End of full overlap
            if prev == k and cnt < k and start is not None:
                ans.append([start, time])
                start = None

        return ans
```

---

### ✅ **Time & Space Complexity:**

* **Time**: `O(N log N)` — N is total number of intervals across all K lists.
* **Space**: `O(N)` — for storing flattened events.

---

### ✅ **Java Version:**

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> intervalIntersectionKLists(List<List<int[]>> intervals) {
        List<int[]> events = new ArrayList<>();

        // Flatten all intervals
        for (List<int[]> list : intervals) {
            for (int[] interval : list) {
                events.add(new int[]{interval[0], 1});
                events.add(new int[]{interval[1], -1});
            }
        }

        // Sort by time, and for same time, start before end
        events.sort((a, b) -> a[0] != b[0] ? a[0] - b[0] : b[1] - a[1]);

        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int cnt = 0;
        Integer start = null;
        int k = intervals.size();

        for (int[] event : events) {
            int time = event[0], type = event[1];
            int prev = cnt;
            cnt += type;

            if (cnt == k && type == 1) {
                start = time;
            }

            if (prev == k && cnt < k && start != null) {
                result.add(Arrays.asList(start, time));
                start = null;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }

Would you like to extend this further to:

* Find intersection among **at least M of K** lists (e.g., “find where at least 3 of 5 lists overlap”)?
* Or find **union of K interval lists**?

Let me know!


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some More Extension. 

Below is an extended “Meta Variant” solution for two related but distinct problems:

Intersection among at least M out of K lists – finding all regions where at least M lists overlap.

Union of K interval lists – merging all intervals from K lists so that overlapping intervals are combined.

In both cases, we use a sweep‑line technique (for intersections) and then a straightforward sort‑and‑merge (for unions). Each solution is provided in both Python and Java, with deep explanations and Telugu comments (using English script).

1. Intersection Among at least M of K Lists
Concept Overview:
Key Idea:
We “flatten” all intervals into events. Each interval produces two events: one for the start (we add 1) and one for the end (we subtract 1).

Sweep-line:
We process events in sorted order (by time). For events that occur at the same time, we ensure that start events are processed before end events.

Logic:

When the running count goes from below M to M (or above) – it means at least M intervals start overlapping → mark this as a potential start.

When the count falls below M, this marks the end of an “at least M” overlap region.

Sorting Note:
We use a custom sort key: sort first by time, and for the same time, sort by type so that start events (e.g., +1) come before end events (e.g., -1).

2. Union of K Interval Lists
Concept Overview:
Key Idea:
The union of intervals means merging any overlapping intervals from all lists.

Steps:

Combine all intervals from each of the K lists.

Sort them by the start time.

Iterate and merge intervals that overlap (if the current interval’s start is less than or equal to the previous interval’s end, then merge them).

Time Complexity:
Sorting takes O(N log N) and merging takes O(N), where N is the total number of intervals.

Summary
Intersection for at least M lists:

We flatten each interval into start/end events.

Sort events with custom key to handle simultaneous events.

Use a running count to detect when the overlap becomes at least M, recording the start and end of each overlapping segment.

Union of intervals:

Combine all intervals from K lists.

Sort by starting time.

Merge overlapping intervals to form the union.

Both approaches are designed to be general, efficient, and easy to extend further if needed. Let me know if you need further details or additional variants!


--------------------------------------------------------------------
One More. 

Let's break this down into two different extensions of the original problem:

Find intersection among at least M of K lists.

Find union of K interval lists.

1. Intersection Among at Least M of K Lists
Problem Statement:
Given K lists of intervals, find the intervals that overlap across at least M of those lists.

Approach for At Least M Lists Intersection:
The logic is similar to the K-list intersection, but instead of counting to K, we will count until M.

We will perform the following steps:

Flatten all intervals with their start and end points.

Sort the events (start and end points).

Sweep through the events and count overlaps.

Whenever the count of active overlaps reaches M, it's considered an intersection.

        for lst in intervals:
            for start, end in lst:
                events.append((start, 1))  # Start event
                events.append((end, -1))   # End event

                ans.append([start, time])
                start = None

Time Complexity for M Lists Intersection:
Time: O(N log N) where N is the total number of intervals across all lists.

Space: O(N) for storing flattened events.

2. Union of K Interval Lists
Problem Statement:
Given K lists of intervals, return the union of all intervals — i.e., a list of intervals where every interval is included in at least one list.

Approach for Union of K Lists:
We will flatten the intervals in the same way.

Sort the intervals.

Merge overlapping intervals into a unified set.

            if cnt == 0 and typ == -1:  # End of an interval

🧠 Concept Recap:
At least M of K lists: Same logic as K lists, but the overlap must reach M.

Union: Merging overlapping intervals, counting active intervals, and producing final merged intervals.
