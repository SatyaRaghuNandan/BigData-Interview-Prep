You've shared a **new variant** of the `Leetcode 827 ‚Äì Making a Large Island` problem:

> üî• **"What if you had to create an island that doesn‚Äôt touch any existing islands?"**

This adds a powerful new constraint:

> When flipping a `0` to a `1`, the newly created island must not **border any existing `1`s**.

---

## ‚úÖ What Is This Variant Doing?

### üí° Goal:

> **Find the largest area** you can build **from `0`s alone**, forming a connected component, such that **no cell in it touches a `1`** in any of the 4 directions.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Components in the Code

### ‚úÖ 1. `borders_land()`

```python
def borders_land(self, grid, row, col):
    ...
    if grid[new_row][new_col] == 1:
        return True
```

* Checks whether a given **cell (0)** **touches any `1`**
* Used both for **seed eligibility** and during recursive DFS

---

### ‚úÖ 2. `create_island()`

```python
def create_island(self, grid, visited, row, col):
    ...
    if self.borders_land(...):
        continue  # üëà prune immediately if it touches land
```

* Starts DFS from a non-bordering 0-cell
* Grows a **purely isolated water-only island**
* Skips any neighbor if **it touches an existing island**

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Main Logic in `largestIsland()`

```python
for row in range(len(grid)):
    for col in range(len(grid[0])):
        if grid[row][col] == 1 or visited[row][col] or borders_land(...):
            continue
        largest = max(largest, create_island(...))
```

* Starts a **new DFS** only from unvisited, non-bordering 0-cells
* Tracks **largest fully isolated region** of 0s

## ‚úÖ Why Is This a Variant?

| Aspect                      | Original 827                       | **This Variant**                                    |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Flip allowed?               | ‚úÖ Yes, one 0 ‚Üí 1                   | ‚úÖ Yes, **any 0s** that are **disconnected from 1s** |
| Can it touch other islands? | ‚úÖ Yes                              | ‚ùå No ‚Äì must be completely isolated                  |
| Max island size logic       | Flip and merge neighboring islands | Form new isolated group of 0s                       |
| DFS style                   | Label and merge islands            | Grow safe water-only patches                        |

## ‚úÖ Complexity Analysis

Let `n x m = N` be grid size

| Component         | Time Complexity | Notes                               |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `borders_land()`  | O(1)            | Only checks 4 neighbors             |
| `create_island()` | O(N) worst-case | Visits all 0s that don‚Äôt touch land |
| Main loop         | O(N)            | Scans all cells once                |
| **Total**         | ‚úÖ O(N)          | Optimized; no redundant visits      |

Space:

* `visited[][]` = O(N)
* Call stack = O(N) (in worst-case flat DFS)

## ‚úÖ Advantages of This Variant

| Feature                        | Advantage                                               |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚ú® Clean constraint enforcement | Only builds on fully isolated regions                   |
| ‚úÖ No grid mutation             | Preserves original input (`grid` is read-only)          |
| üîç Focused traversal           | Skips all border-touching 0s early (via `borders_land`) |
| ‚ö° Efficient and readable       | Single DFS, no ID mapping or hashmaps                   |

---

## ‚úÖ Interview-Ready Summary

> ‚ÄúThis variant restricts island creation to regions that don‚Äôt touch any existing islands. We use a `borders_land()` function to identify if a cell is adjacent to a `1`, and then perform a DFS from eligible 0-cells to grow isolated islands. This ensures only disconnected regions are considered. The solution runs in `O(N)` time and space using visited tracking and in-place DFS growth.‚Äù

Would you like:

* Python version that also **returns the island cells**, not just size?
* Extension: **build multiple such isolated islands** for total area?
* Visualization of the decision boundaries (e.g., borders of invalid 0s)?
