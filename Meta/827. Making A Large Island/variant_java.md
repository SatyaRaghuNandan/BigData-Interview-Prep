Absolutely ‚Äî you're dealing with a **variant of LeetCode 827**, and your question is very insightful:

## üîÅ Recap of the Variant:

### ‚ùì What's the difference?

> ‚úÖ Instead of **flipping one `0` to `1`** to **connect** existing islands (original 827),
> üîÑ You're now trying to **grow a completely new island** made **only from `0`s** that are:

* ‚úÖ Connected to each other,
* ‚ùå Not **touching any existing land (`1`)**.

## ‚úÖ Key Differences vs Original LeetCode 827

| Concept      | LeetCode 827 (Original)                          | üî• Variant You Shared                                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Flip         | Flip **one** `0 ‚Üí 1`                             | Use **all** isolated `0`s (no touch with land)               |
| Goal         | Merge existing islands for largest area          | Build **brand-new isolated island** from 0s                  |
| DFS Purpose  | Label islands and compute size of possible merge | Grow connected 0-region that doesn‚Äôt border any `1`          |
| Edge Checks  | Check 4 neighbors to merge (if land)             | Reject DFS path if neighbor touches `1` (via `borders_land`) |
| Max Strategy | `max = max(existing + new)`                      | `max = max(isolated_dfs_results)`                            |
| Complexity   | `O(N^2)` with grid mutation + set for neighbors  | ‚úÖ `O(N^2)` DFS with early pruning, no mutation               |
| Memory       | `Map<IslandID, Size> + Set`                      | `visited[][]` + recursion stack                              |

## üß† How to Easily Remember This Variant

### üìå Use This 3-Part Mental Template:

1. **Skip all border-touching 0s:**

   ```python
   if borders_land(grid, r, c): continue
   ```

2. **Use DFS only from truly isolated 0s:**

   ```python
   if grid[r][c] == 0 and not visited[r][c] and !borders_land(...):
       dfs(...)
   ```

3. **Prune inside DFS when a neighbor touches a 1:**

   ```python
   if borders_land(grid, nr, nc): continue
   ```

## ‚úÖ Code Behavior Differences (Side-by-Side)

| Snippet         | Original Leetcode 827                  | Variant (Your Code)                               |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Entry condition | `if grid[r][c] == 0 ‚Üí try flipping`    | `if grid[r][c] == 0 and not visited and !borders` |
| DFS Merge       | `dfs(grid, r, c, id)` to label islands | `dfs(grid, r, c)` for isolated 0-only region      |
| Neighbor Check  | Add size from neighbors (if `1`)       | Prune neighbor if `borders_land(...)`             |
| Data Structures | `Map<id, size>`, `Set<neighborIds>`    | `visited[][]`, `int size`                         |

## ‚úÖ Time & Space Complexity Summary

| Component        | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Why?                        |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| `borders_land()` | `O(1)`          | `O(1)`           | Checks only 4 cells         |
| DFS Growth       | `O(N^2)`        | `O(N^2)`         | Worst-case all 0s (no land) |
| Overall          | ‚úÖ `O(N^2)`      | ‚úÖ `O(N^2)`       | Optimal for this constraint |

## ‚úÖ Interview-Ready Summary:

> ‚ÄúThis is a variant of Leetcode 827 where we must grow a new island using only `0`s that do not touch any `1`s in the grid. The trick is to use a helper function to prune any 0 that borders land and then grow isolated connected components using DFS. Each time, we compare and track the size of such valid disconnected islands. The logic ensures that we build a pure water island with no contact to land, in `O(N^2)` time and space.‚Äù
