Fantastic — you're now looking at a **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)** or **Union-Find**-based solution for **Leetcode 827 – Making a Large Island**. This is a highly optimized approach and offers several **practical and theoretical advantages** over DFS/BFS.

Let’s analyze in detail:

---

## ✅ What's Being Used Here?

### ✅ **Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find) with Union by Size + Path Compression**

```python
class DisjointSet:
    ...
    def find_root(...)        ← Path compression
    def union_nodes(...)      ← Union by size
```

* Each `1` in the grid is a node.
* All connected 1s are grouped into the **same disjoint set**.
* Each disjoint set tracks its **size** using `island_size[]`.
* When flipping a `0` to `1`, we check **adjacent island roots** and **sum their sizes** to get the new size.

---

## ✅ Why This Approach is Advantageous

| Feature                               | Advantage                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🧠 **Avoids DFS/BFS Recursion/Queue** | Doesn’t use recursion → no stack overflow for large grids; no queue allocations                              |
| 📊 **Fast Lookup**                    | `find_root()` is near-constant time with **path compression**                                                |
| ⚙️ **Modular Union Operations**       | Each union operation is fast and scalable                                                                    |
| 🔍 **Direct Area Lookup**             | Instead of re-traversing components to compute area, we use `island_size[root]` instantly                    |
| 🧱 **Better Cache Locality**          | Works on a 1D flattened grid (`row * columns + col`) — better for memory access patterns on very large grids |
| 🔀 **Efficient Deduplication**        | Adjacent island roots are stored in a `set()` — avoids re-counting same island when flipping a `0`           |

---

## ✅ Time and Space Complexity

Let `n = rows`, `m = columns` → Grid size = `N = n × m`

| Phase                            | Time Complexity          | Space Complexity    |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------- |
| **Union of all 1s**              | `O(N * α(N))`            | `O(N)` (DSU arrays) |
| **Flip each 0, check neighbors** | `O(N)` (4 neighbors × N) | `O(1)` (set reused) |
| **Total**                        | ✅ `O(N * α(N))`          | ✅ `O(N)`            |

> `α(N)` is the inverse Ackermann function — **very slow-growing**, nearly constant.

✅ **This is the best known time complexity** for this problem.

## ✅ Practical Comparison to DFS/BFS

| Technique       | Time Complexity | Stack/Queue | Grid Modifies In-Place? | Handles Very Large Grid?  |
| --------------- | --------------- | ----------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| DFS (recursive) | `O(N)`          | Recursion   | ✅ Yes                   | ❌ Risk of stack overflow  |
| BFS (queue)     | `O(N)`          | Queue       | ✅ Yes                   | ⚠️ Can use lots of memory |
| ✅ DSU (this)    | ✅ `O(N * α(N))` | ❌ None      | ❌ Does not touch grid   | ✅ Ideal for large grids   |

---

## ✅ When is DSU Preferred?

| Scenario                                      | DSU is Ideal? |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Grid is **huge** (10⁶+ cells)                 | ✅             |
| Need **fast merge/lookups** of components     | ✅             |
| Want to **precompute** connected regions once | ✅             |
| Need to **flip 0s** and **merge areas**       | ✅             |
| Just counting components or sizes             | DFS/BFS fine  |

## 🧠 Interview-Ready Summary

> "This solution uses Disjoint Set Union (DSU) to group all 1s into connected components. Each 1 is assigned to a disjoint set, and we track the size of each island. Then for each 0-cell, we check its neighboring sets and compute the potential new island size by merging them. DSU with union by size and path compression gives nearly constant time for union/find operations, making it efficient even for large grids. The total time complexity is O(N \* α(N)) and space is O(N), which is optimal for this problem."
