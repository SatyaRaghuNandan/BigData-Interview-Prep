Great ‚Äî you're analyzing a variation of **Leetcode 827 ‚Äì Making a Large Island** again, and asking:

> üîç **What is being used here? Is this DFS or BFS or something else? Why is it structured this way?**

Let's walk through it precisely:

---

## ‚úÖ What Is Being Used in This Code?

### ‚úÖ **1. Recursive DFS (Depth-First Search)**

```python
def label_island(self, grid, id, row, col):
    ...
    for r_offset, c_offset in self.directions:
        ...
        size += self.label_island(grid, id, new_row, new_col)
```

üîπ This is a classic **recursive DFS** ‚Äî it explores each island cell and labels it with a unique `id`.

* **Marks visited nodes** by writing `id` into the `grid`
* **Accumulates area** (`size`) recursively
* Avoids extra `visited` set because visited cells are overwritten

---

### ‚úÖ **2. HashMap (`id_to_island_size`) to store island areas**

```python
id_to_island_size[id] = size
```

* This avoids recomputing island sizes when checking `0`s later
* Every `0` only looks at its 4 neighbors and sums up **unique** island IDs using:

  ```python
  if grid[new_row][new_col] in visited: continue
  ```

---

### ‚úÖ **3. Directional Traversal (4 directions)**

```python
self.directions = [(-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1)]
```

This ensures 4-directional adjacency is used (per problem constraints).

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Algorithm Summary

### üîπ Phase 1: Label all existing islands

* Traverse each cell
* When you see `1`, call DFS to label all connected `1`s with a unique `id`
* Store the area of each island

‚úÖ Time: `O(N¬≤)`, each cell visited once
‚úÖ Method used: **recursive DFS**

---

### üîπ Phase 2: Try flipping each `0`

* For each `0`, look at up to 4 neighboring island IDs
* Use a `set()` to avoid double-counting duplicates
* Sum the sizes of those unique islands + 1 (the flipped cell)

‚úÖ Time: `O(N¬≤)`
‚úÖ Efficient due to constant 4-direction lookup

---

## ‚úÖ Time and Space Complexity

| Phase                   | Time      | Space     | Notes                                       |
| ----------------------- | --------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| DFS labeling of islands | `O(N¬≤)`   | `O(N¬≤)`   | Recursion stack in worst case (deep island) |
| Storing island sizes    | `O(K)`    | `O(K)`    | K = number of islands (‚â™ N¬≤)                |
| Flip-check for each 0   | `O(N¬≤)`   | `O(1)`    | 4 neighbors max                             |
| **Overall**             | ‚úÖ `O(N¬≤)` | ‚úÖ `O(N¬≤)` | Optimal                                     |

---

## ‚úÖ Advantages of This Implementation

| Feature                          | Benefit                                    |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Uses recursive DFS               | Simple, concise island labeling            |
| Mutates grid to avoid visited\[] | Saves memory                               |
| HashMap for island size          | Avoids redundant recomputation             |
| 4-direction traversal            | Matches problem requirement                |
| `set()` during flipping          | Prevents double-counting connected islands |

---

## ‚úÖ Interview-Ready Summary

> ‚ÄúThis solution uses recursive DFS to label each island with a unique ID and compute its area. We use a dictionary to map island IDs to their sizes. Then, for every 0-cell, we simulate flipping it to 1 and calculate the potential size by merging unique neighboring islands. The use of in-place labeling avoids extra space, and we achieve `O(N¬≤)` time and space, optimal for this class of problems.‚Äù

* This rewritten using **iterative DFS or BFS** to avoid recursion?
* This broken down as a **modular template** for other grid labeling problems (like surrounded regions or color fill)?
