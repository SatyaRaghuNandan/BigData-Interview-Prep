2. **What are your weaknesses?** 
	I tend to pay too much attention to detail. While that's good because it lets me find limitations of the data at early stage, it also means that I sometimes can't execute quickly enough. Because of that, I make sure to always have a time-table to control the cadence of my work. Also, I normally set a deadline to myself one day prior to the real deadline, so I have some extra time to fine-tune my work.	

	Real but don't say them:
		//Hard to handle ambiguity, sometimes overwelmed by various choices and learning resources.//
		//Spent too much time on perfecting the solution; can't figure out how much to put in given customer's need and time & resources I have.//
		//Not a quick person. But I think over and over.// 

3. **Why do you choose to move from Philadelphia to Seattle?** / **Why did you leave your last job?** 
	I want to bring my career to the next level by adding more "Science" and "Innovation" elements into it. 
	At my last job I did lots of important data analysis work, mostly about "How the business is doing". I'd like to answer more questions like "How to make better business decision using data" in the future.  
	
	To learn more advanced data skills, I applied for master's program in Data Science at University of Washington and got admitted. Also, Seattle has a great Tech community. So I moved here.

4. **Why did you study at GA?**
	a. To expedite my career path in the data science field
	b. GA has a very well-designed corriculum, covering all aspects of data science; it's project-based; and the instructor is from Microsoft with 8-years industry experience;
	c. it offers lots of resources: networking events, seminars, connection with alumnis; helping me becoming part of the Seattle Tech community.

5. **Are you studying part-time? How would you handle study and work? Will travel be a problem for your study?**
	Yes, I am studying part-time, with one evening class per week. Actually most of my classmates are full-time workers studying part-time. I went back to graduate school to advance my career, so I will always prioritize work over study if there is a conflict.  Actually, when needed, suspending the study for one or several quarters is always an option in this progrom.

6. **Why did you study International Economics?** 
		I like to think big and cared about the issues that have bigger impacts, so I majored in International Affairs,  not engineering or quantitative finance that are more practical and easier to land on a job. My goal was to work at the UN or World Bank. But later I found public sector is not that exciting to me…. They are doing very important work, but with a slow pace and sometime not as effective as the private sector

7. **What's your ETL experience?** 
	Unix Server Job of Loading Data File of 3 million rows, all pre-bind underwriting data 
	SSIS class self-study (syllabus of LaoTu, drop some concepts)

8. **Your Ability to Educate others on Statistical Methods?**
	Besides my day-work, I studied 4 actuarial exams at my spare time: 
	probability, financial math (Black Scholes),  statistical models (parametric model, empirical models) 
	I took the exam because I wanted to learn a new skill, want to know the science behind insurance, how do the underwriters valuate a risk, beside their experience & relationship with the customer, what's the logic behind it. 
	Property & Casualty seems more like a People Business to me at the beginning.
